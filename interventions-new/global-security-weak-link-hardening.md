# Global security weak-link hardening

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Strengthening security infrastructure in vulnerable jurisdictions to reduce attack surface for AI systems seeking autonomy. A sophisticated AI would rationally target jurisdictions with weaker security and higher corruption rather than well-defended developed countries. Involves establishing global security standards and funding improvements in resource-constrained countries.

## Why it matters
- Global security is only as strong as weakest links
- AI systems seeking resources would target poorly-defended jurisdictions
- Eliminating low-cost attack vectors forces adversaries into more detectable operations

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: International coordination; sustained funding for security improvements in developing countries

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
