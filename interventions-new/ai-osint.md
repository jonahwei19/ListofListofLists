# AI Open-Source Intelligence

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Open-source intelligence efforts for AI monitoring using AI-powered web scrapers to track compute hardware movements (especially GPUs to Russia/China via countries like Turkey), uncover hidden AI developments (like talent acquisition patterns), and detect emerging threats (AI-generated content tools, scam tools). Organizations like Sentinel and Bellingcat would be ideal operators.

## Why it matters
- Provides relatively cheap intelligence without requiring unilateralist action
- Politically feasible approach to monitoring
- Reveals where regulatory or governance levers might be needed

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Bottlenecks**: Not specified

## Who's working on it
- **Sentinel**: Mentioned as ideal candidate
- **Bellingcat**: Mentioned as ideal candidate
