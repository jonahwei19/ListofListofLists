# AI safety lobbying organization

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Dedicated 501(c)(4) political lobbying organization for AI safety, structured to enable direct political activity unlike research nonprofits.

**Mechanism**:
- 501(c)(4) structure allows direct political lobbying (unlike 501(c)(3) research organizations)
- Can shape legislation directly, not just publish research
- Influence regulatory agencies (FTC, NIST, state regulators)
- Build coalitions with other advocacy groups
- Hire professional lobbyists with Capitol Hill relationships
- Full-time focus on political influence rather than research with advocacy as side activity

**Why dedicated organization vs. existing groups**: Research organizations (501(c)(3)) are legally restricted from lobbying. Effective political influence requires full-time focus and appropriate legal structure.

## Why it matters
- Technical solutions require political will to implement
- Current AI safety organizations are structured as research nonprofits with lobbying restrictions
- Dedicated lobbying enables direct influence on legislation and regulation
- Professional lobbyists have relationships and expertise academics lack

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Organization formation; recruiting political professionals; sustained funding; finding leaders with both AI knowledge and political experience

## Who's working on it
- **No dedicated 501(c)(4) for AI safety identified**
