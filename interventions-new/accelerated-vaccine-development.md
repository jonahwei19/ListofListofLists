# Accelerated vaccine development

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Compress vaccine development and deployment from years to weeks through platform technologies (mRNA, viral vector), pre-positioned manufacturing capacity, and streamlined regulatory pathways. The specific target: **100 days from pathogen identification to emergency use authorization**. Platform technologies require only the pathogen genetic sequence to begin design. CEPI's framework outlines tiered response: 100 days for familiar pathogens with known vaccine candidates, 150-180 days for pathogens similar to prototypes, and 200-230 days for truly novel pathogens.

## Why it matters
- COVID-19 vaccines took 326 days despite unprecedented speed; millions died during that gap
- mRNA platforms proved design can happen in days once sequence is known
- Bottleneck shifted to trials, manufacturing, and distribution, which can be pre-solved
- 100-day vaccines transform pandemic response from "accept deaths while waiting" to "limit mortality through rapid deployment"

## Current state
- **Status**: Research/Pilot
- **Scale**: CEPI aims to develop ~100 prototype vaccines covering all viral families with pandemic potential
- **Recent progress (2024-2025)**:
  - WHO R&D Blueprint 2024 update identified priority and prototype pathogens
  - CEPI's CMC rapid response framework published (manufacturing processes, formulation, analytics, supply chain, facilities)
  - December 2025: CEPI investing $54.3M for Moderna's mRNA H5 pandemic influenza vaccine Phase 3 trial—first mRNA pandemic flu vaccine to reach pivotal trial
  - February 2025: $4.7M to DNA Script to automate synthetic DNA template manufacturing, accelerating mRNA production especially in Global South
  - CEPI supporting 70+ vaccine candidates/platform technologies against multiple high-risk pathogens
  - Africa mRNA manufacturing capacity being established for pre-clinical to commercial scale
- **Bottlenecks**: Manufacturing surge capacity requires pre-investment; regulatory pathways balance speed vs. safety; global distribution infrastructure; platform maturity varies by pathogen type

## Who's working on it
- **CEPI**: Leading 100-day vaccine initiative, G7/G20 endorsed
- **Moderna, BioNTech**: mRNA platform development
- **MRC The Gambia, International Vaccine Institute**: Clinical research network partners
- **BARDA, ARPA-H**: US government pandemic preparedness programs
