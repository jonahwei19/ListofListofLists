# AI safety implementation consulting

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Third-party service providing forward-deployed engineers to implement Redwood control techniques and other safety measures. Rather than just publishing research, provides implementation expertise that removes the barrier between safety research and deployment. Makes adoption easier by doing the work for companies.

## Why it matters
- Safety research often produces techniques that are never adopted due to implementation barriers
- Companies lack expertise or resources to translate research into practice
- Engineers who can directly implement safety measures ensure techniques actually get used

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Building implementation expertise; business model for deployment

## Who's working on it
- **Redwood Research**: Source of control techniques to be deployed
