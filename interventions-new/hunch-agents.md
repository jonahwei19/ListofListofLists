# Automated alignment hypothesis generation

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
AI systems that replicate creative scientific thinking to autonomously generate novel hypotheses and alignment approaches. Rather than pursuing specific technical solutions, automates the discovery process itself. Creates a feedback loop where AI helps develop better alignment techniques for increasingly capable AI systems.

## Why it matters
- Alignment research may need to progress faster than human researchers can work alone
- Automating discovery for alignment could provide acceleration needed to stay ahead of capabilities
- Turns AI into a tool for its own safety
