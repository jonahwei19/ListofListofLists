# Large-scale AI safety media campaign

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Sustained communications campaign ($50-250M annually) to shape public understanding of AI risks and counter anti-regulation messaging.

**Mechanism**:
- Professional communications campaign at corporate scale (comparable to major corporate communications budgets)
- Proactive messaging about AI safety needs across TV, digital, print
- Counter-campaigns opposing anti-regulation efforts
- Bipartisan framing to preserve governance paths across political spectrum
- Message testing to optimize effectiveness before major spend
- Sustained multi-year presence (not one-off campaigns)

**Why this scale**: AI safety messaging is drastically outspent by pro-industry communications. Winning the narrative requires comparable investment.

## Why it matters
- Mass media shapes public perception more than expert reports
- Creates political will for governance measures
- Prevents industry capture of AI narrative
- Climate change shows public opinion shift requires sustained communications investment

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Funding at scale ($50-250M annually); campaign strategy expertise; avoiding partisan capture; measuring effectiveness

## Who's working on it
- **No active campaign at this scale identified**
