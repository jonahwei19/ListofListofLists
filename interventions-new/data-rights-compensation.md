# Data Rights Compensation

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Frameworks for compensating individuals whose data is used in AI training, particularly focusing on high-skilled or vulnerable sector labor contributions. The ideal system would be "incentive compatible" while providing "good data and good oversight." Focuses specifically on compensation and rights for individuals whose data trains AI models (distinct from broader questions of who owns AI-generated economic value).

## Why it matters
- Creates economic returns for data contributors while ensuring quality data governance
- Addresses fairness concerns about AI systems profiting from others' contributions
- Aligns incentives between data providers and AI developers
