# Wearable infection detection

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Create next-generation wearables for host response-based diagnosis that detect physiological anomalies indicating infection without identifying the specific pathogen. Rather than competing with commercial wearables, the approach identifies measurements beyond current capabilities and operationalizes existing devices for an early warning biodefense ecosystem. Leverages existing wearable technology momentum and user acceptance while developing missing components. Addresses the fundamental challenge: "What do you look for when you don't know what you're looking for?"

## Why it matters
- Novel or engineered pathogens may evade specific diagnostic tests
- Host response detection works against any biological threat including unanticipated ones
- Distributed detection through consumer devices creates population-level early warning system

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Identifying physiological signatures that reliably indicate early infection; false positive rates in population-scale deployment; privacy concerns; integration with existing wearable platforms

## Who's working on it
