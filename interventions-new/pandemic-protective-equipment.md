# Pandemic protective equipment

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Next-generation personal protective equipment designed for mass stockpiling and rapid population-wide distribution during pandemics. Key design requirements: low manufacturing cost for billion-unit stockpiles, reliable protection without expert fitting, and multi-year shelf life for strategic reserves. Protection levels should approach professional-grade (better than N95) while remaining usable by untrained general population.

## Why it matters
- Current high-protection PPE (PAPRs, N95+, hazmat) requires expert fitting and training
- Simple PPE (cloth masks, surgical masks) provides limited protection
- Gap exists for "good enough" protection that works at population scale during emergencies
- Engineered pandemics may require immediate population-wide protection before vaccines available

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Manufacturing cost reduction; shelf-life optimization; usability testing with non-expert populations; regulatory pathway for emergency stockpiles

## Who's working on it
