# Economic Impact Tracking

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Data collection and analysis on how AI systems affect economic outcomes and job displacement across sectors. Tracks economic metrics to proactively identify emerging patterns before they become widespread societal problems. Provides concrete evidence of AI's real-world impacts for policy responses.

## Why it matters
- Without empirical data on actual impacts, policy responses will be reactive rather than proactive
- Early detection of displacement patterns enables intervention before crises
- Helps society recognize and address concerns about technological disempowerment
