# Safety research synthesis

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Better information-sharing mechanisms for topics where experts hold dramatically different assessments (e.g., mechanistic interpretability). Involves publishing analyses that clarify current cruxes in technical debates and generating evidence to resolve them rather than letting uncertainty persist indefinitely. Pays down research debt from fragmented discussions with little consensus-building.

## Why it matters
- Key disagreements persist without resolution; experts can't evaluate each other's claims
- Resources wasted on parallel efforts that could be coordinated
- Systematic synthesis identifies which uncertainties actually matter and creates shared understanding
