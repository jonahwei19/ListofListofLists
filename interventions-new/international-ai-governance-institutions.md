# International AI governance institutions

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
International institutional infrastructure for AI governance and safety research. Two complementary models:

**WHO-like frontier model forum**: Allocate large-scale funding (hundreds of millions USD) to organizations like METR while developing an international forum structured like the WHO but focused on AI threat models. Unlike the current Frontier Model Forum which excludes key players (DeepSeek, xAI), this organization would abandon exclusive membership for universal participation. The goal is facilitating international treaty development and red line enforcement before concerns like biological weapons uplift become critical.

**CERN-like research consortium**: Create an international AI development consortium similar to CERN or Intelsat that allows unified research without competitive pressures. Defers complex technical safety decisions to the project itself rather than attempting to coordinate disparate corporate efforts. CERN-like infrastructure would enable experiments impossible elsewhere, particularly safety research requiring extraordinary computational resources. Serves as a neutral, international testbed for evaluating advanced AI systems under controlled conditions.

## Why it matters
- Current Frontier Model Forum excludes key players, limiting effectiveness
- Competitive dynamics between labs and nations accelerate development while undermining safety
- Universal participation prevents race-to-the-bottom dynamics on safety
- Collaborative safety research requiring massive compute is currently impossible
- A neutral testbed could enable rigorous evaluation that no single lab would undertake alone

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot (limited forums) / Idea (research consortium)
- **Bottlenecks**: Funding at required scale; geopolitical tensions complicate universal membership; China participation particularly challenging; governance structure unclear; requires dramatically expanding government role in technology decisions

## Who's working on it
- **METR**: Proposed recipient of expanded funding
- **Frontier Model Forum**: Existing but limited version
