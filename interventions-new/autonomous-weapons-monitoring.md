# Autonomous weapons monitoring systems

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Comprehensive monitoring systems tracking AI applications in weaponry, particularly autonomous decision-making capabilities. Creates transparency about which systems maintain meaningful human oversight versus full autonomy. Requires international agreements, technical verification methods, and proliferation limits. Critical for preventing autonomous systems from escalating conflicts without human intervention.

## Why it matters
- Autonomous weapons that escalate without human authorization create catastrophic risks
- Monitoring provides early warning
- Creates accountability that deters dangerous developments

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: International coordination; verification technology; defining "meaningful human oversight"

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
