# AI training disruption cyberweapons

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Specialized cyberweapons designed to disrupt, sabotage, or shut down unauthorized AI training runs. Analogous to Stuxnet (developed by studying centrifuges), would require acquiring GPUs to discover zero-day vulnerabilities specific to AI systems. Serves as deterrence against unauthorized AGI development and emergency intervention capability.

## Why it matters
- Verification and treaties require enforcement mechanisms
- Credible deterrent against unauthorized development
- Emergency intervention capability when diplomatic measures fail

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Technical development requires specialized hardware access; policy questions about authorization and escalation

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
