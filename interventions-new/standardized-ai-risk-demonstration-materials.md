# Standardized AI risk demonstration materials

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Professional video content and presentation materials showcasing AI capabilities and risks for use by lobbyists and advocates.

**Mechanism**:
- Professional production quality videos demonstrating AI capabilities
- Standardized presentations that can be used across different audiences
- Replaces individual one-on-one demonstrations with scalable content
- Lobbyists can show materials without needing technical expertise themselves
- Content tested for effectiveness before distribution
- Materials can reach thousands vs. individual demonstrations reaching dozens

**Why standardized materials**: Individual lobbyists are constrained by time and lack compelling visuals. Standardized materials multiply reach while maintaining quality.

## Why it matters
- Lobbyists constrained by time and lack of compelling visual materials
- Professional production enhances credibility
- Standardized materials enable consistent messaging at scale
- Frees advocates from needing to create materials from scratch

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Production resources; testing for effectiveness; distribution to advocacy network; keeping materials current as capabilities advance

## Who's working on it
- **No dedicated effort identified**
