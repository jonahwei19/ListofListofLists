# Academia-industry translation

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Mechanisms to transfer AI security research from academic institutions to commercial applications. Currently the handoff is weak: findings rely on closed weights/data, lack reproducible code, don't have benchmarks tied to deployment constraints, and don't map to security/compliance requirements. Creates standardized processes and incentives to bridge theory and implementation.

## Why it matters
- Academic safety research often never gets deployed due to no systematic pathway
- Companies lack resources to translate academic findings; academics aren't incentivized to make work deployment-ready
- Potentially valuable safety techniques sit unused while deployed systems remain vulnerable

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Incentive structures; reproducibility requirements; deployment-ready code

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
