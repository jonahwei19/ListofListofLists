# Low-stakes alignment settings

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Environments requiring multiple consecutive malicious actions to produce harmful outcomes. Uses solid sandboxing around agent environments so no bad outcome occurs unless the sandbox is deliberately breached. Creates multiple layers of protection where oversight has several chances to detect problematic behavior rather than relying on perfect first-action detection.

## Why it matters
- Perfect alignment may be unachievable, but defense-in-depth provides practical safety
- Multiple intervention points mean imperfect oversight can still catch threats
- Converts single-point-of-failure systems into resilient chains
