## What it is
Surveillance, monitoring, and verification technologies that track hardware supply chains, chip deployments, power grid construction, and computing infrastructure globally. Combines OSINT and privacy-preserving cryptographic methods to verify what activities occur inside data centers. Information distributed through diplomatic channels rather than complete public disclosure to avoid triggering adversarial reactions.

## Why it matters
- Provides transparency to prevent miscalculations between major powers
- Prevents countries from accelerating AI development out of fear others are doing the same
- Collects critical intelligence about AI development capacity without revealing sources
