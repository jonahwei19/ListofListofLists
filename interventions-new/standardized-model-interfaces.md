# Standardized AI model access interfaces

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Standardized interfaces for the AI ecosystem (like USB-C universality), enabling consistent interaction with all models regardless of origin. Currently each lab uses different interfaces, forcing auditors and researchers to negotiate separate access arrangements with each company, potentially delaying critical safety work by months. Could be implemented "within a year."

## Why it matters
- Fragmented interfaces slow safety research and auditing
- Duplicated work, delayed assessments, incompatible tools
- Standardization enables ecosystem to move at speed of fastest developer

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Lab coordination; defining standard that accommodates different architectures; governance of standard

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
