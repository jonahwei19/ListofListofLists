# AI debate verification

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Using adversarial debate between AI systems for verification and oversight. Two complementary components:

**Cross-examination verification**: Verification systems where AI-generated plans and analyses are automatically cross-referenced and checked through mechanisms similar to "AI safety via debate." Multiple AI instances conduct deep research and produce reports that are then automatically cross-examined to highlight missing perspectives. Creates a "first version of scalable bureaucracy" with humans reviewing critical decisions across all levels.

**Debate theory**: Mathematical frameworks for debate as a scalable oversight method, using interactive proof systems adapted for AI safety. Involves formalizing theorem statements, defining constraints, and building theories that satisfy both theoretical computer science and complexity theory communities. Identifies gaps between theory and practical implementation and develops testable conjectures.

## Why it matters
- AI systems may optimize for metrics that do not capture intended goals (Goodhart's Law)
- Cross-examination between AI systems can surface problems invisible to single-model review
- Debate is proposed as a scalable oversight method where AI systems argue positions and humans judge
- For this to work reliably, need mathematical proofs of when the true answer wins
- Without rigorous theory, debate could fail subtly at scale or against adversarial systems

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Technical difficulty of implementing effective debate protocols; AI systems may share blind spots; humans still needed for final review creates scaling limits; formalizing conditions under which debate produces truth; bridging theory to implementation

## Who's working on it
- Builds on AI safety via debate research at Anthropic, OpenAI
