# AI-Powered AI Surveillance

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
AI systems that continuously monitor other AI systems, looking for anomalous behaviors or market activities indicating concerning capability developments. Functions as a surveillance network and "private investigators" to catch anomalous AI behaviors early. Implementation requires web-scale scraping expertise; could draw from DEFCON-style talent pools and turn monitoring into competitive capture-the-flag challenges to identify hidden compute resources.

## Why it matters
- Human monitoring cannot scale to the speed and complexity of AI-to-AI interactions
- AI-powered surveillance enables detection at necessary scale
- Competitive challenges attract security talent to the problem
