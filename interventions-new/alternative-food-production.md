# Alternative food production infrastructure

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Pre-positioning alternative food production capabilities for scenarios where conventional agriculture fails: seaweed cultivation and knowledge transfer to suitable regions (e.g., Nigeria), specialized seedbanks, and conversion pathways for industrial facilities (paper mills) to emergency food production via cellulose processing.

## Why it matters
- AI-catalyzed catastrophes (nuclear war, infrastructure collapse) could disrupt global food supply chains rapidly
- Alternative food capacity prevents mass starvation scenarios
- Knowledge transfer to appropriate climates builds distributed resilience

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Knowledge transfer to regions with suitable climates but no expertise; industrial conversion pathways need development

## Who's working on it
- **ALLFED**: Research on alternative foods and resilient food systems
