# Vulnerability-research matching

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
System that directly connects discovered AI vulnerabilities to research proposals addressing them. Ensures funding flows to researchers tackling actual identified problems rather than theoretical concerns. Continuously updates as new vulnerabilities are discovered through red teaming, creating rapid feedback loop between threat identification and solution development.

## Why it matters
- Safety research funding is disconnected from actual discovered vulnerabilities
- Red teams find problems but funding goes to proposals based on different criteria
- Matching system ensures resources go directly to solving identified problems
