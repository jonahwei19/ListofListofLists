# Academic project scaling

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Funding and operational support to scale academic research agendas that work at small scale but aren't expanded because academics prioritize novelty over scaling. MIT's Tenenbaum lab specifically mentioned as having promising results that languished without resources for deployment.

## Why it matters
- Academia incentivizes novelty, not scaling
- Many promising approaches are proven at small scale but never tested at production scale
- Providing resources for scaling proven approaches unlocks stranded proof-of-concept value

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Academic incentive structures; operational support for scaling

## Who's working on it
- **MIT Tenenbaum Lab**: Example candidate with promising unscaled results
