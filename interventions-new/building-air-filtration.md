# Building air filtration

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Improve building HVAC systems to reduce respiratory pathogen transmission. Indoor spaces are far more dangerous than outdoor spaces for airborne disease transmission, making ventilation upgrades a high-leverage intervention. Includes both filtration improvements (HEPA/MERV upgrades) and increased air exchange rates. Infrastructure-level intervention that protects everyone in the space without requiring individual compliance.

## Why it matters
- Addresses fundamental environmental factor in airborne transmission
- Building-level improvements provide passive protection without behavioral change
- Works against any airborne pathogen including novel or engineered threats
- Complements other air-cleaning approaches (UV, Far-UVC)

## Current state
- **Status**: Deployment
- **Bottlenecks**: Building code updates; retrofit costs for existing buildings; energy consumption tradeoffs; maintenance requirements for high-performance systems

## Who's working on it
- Not specified (public health agencies, building standards organizations)
