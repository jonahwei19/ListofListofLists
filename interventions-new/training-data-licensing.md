# Training Data Licensing

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
A regulated market for high-quality, difficult-to-replicate training data (scientific papers, professional knowledge, etc.) that cannot yet be automated. Fairly compensates those whose data is used for AI training while providing nations and regulatory bodies leverage over AI development. Companies needing specialized data must comply with regulations to maintain access, creating "natural incentives for companies to sign up" to oversight mechanisms.

## Why it matters
- Creates economic incentives for compliance with governance frameworks by controlling access to valuable training data
- Provides leverage for regulators without requiring heavy enforcement
- Addresses fairness concerns about AI profiting from others' contributions
