# RSP Implementation

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Transforming existing Responsible Scaling Policies (RSPs) from theoretical frameworks into actionable implementation plans. Develops concrete, tested "if-then commitments" with ready-to-deploy protocols for when safety boundaries are approached. Builds social mechanisms including public accountability and transparency requirements to ensure compliance. Significant focus on creating industry-wide norms and social pressure that makes non-compliance reputationally costly.

## Why it matters
- Current RSPs are theoretical commitments without tested implementation
- Without concrete protocols and enforcement mechanisms, commitments may not be honored under pressure
- Social pressure mechanisms complement technical and legal enforcement

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot/Deployed (varies by lab)
- **Recent developments (2024-2025)**:
  - Anthropic: October 2024 RSP update introduced safety case methodology, new capability thresholds, board approval requirements, Long Term Benefit Trust consultation
  - OpenAI: "Preparedness Framework" approach with capability-based risk assessment
  - Google DeepMind: Frontier Safety Framework (2024), anticipates deceptive alignment in near-future models
  - Microsoft: Frontier Governance Framework (2025)
  - Meta: Frontier AI Framework (2025), focused on catastrophic misuse by human actors
  - Amazon: Frontier Model Safety Framework (2025)
- **Convergence**: All major labs now use capability-based thresholds classifying models by dangerous capabilities
- **Divergence**: DeepMind/Anthropic anticipate deceptive alignment; Meta/Amazon focus on misuse by humans
- **Bottlenecks**: Implementation varies across labs; commitments untested under real pressure; "promissory note" criticism

## Who's working on it
- **Anthropic**: Pioneered RSPs (September 2023), most detailed framework with AI Safety Levels (ASL)
- **OpenAI**: Preparedness Framework
- **Google DeepMind**: Frontier Safety Framework
- **Microsoft, Meta, Amazon**: Published frameworks in 2025
- **AI Lab Watch**: Tracking and comparing RSP commitments across labs
