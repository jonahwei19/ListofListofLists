# Scientific consensus building for AI risk

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Large-scale empirical demonstrations and studies that make AI risks vivid through concrete, uncontrived evidence rather than abstract theory. Aims for scientific consensus comparable to climate change, potentially through Nature-level publications covering both specific instances and broader patterns. Provides politicians and public with firm evidence base for risk claims.

## Why it matters
- Policy action requires scientific consensus
- Climate policy only became viable after decades of consensus-building
- Accelerating this process compresses timeline from awareness to action

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Designing compelling demonstrations; publication in high-impact venues; avoiding perception of advocacy science

## Who's working on it
- **Apollo Research**: Demonstrations and empirical studies
