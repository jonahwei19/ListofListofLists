# AI compute supply chain coordination

**Tag**: Policy

## What it is
Organizing key nations in the AI chip supply chain to recognize and coordinate their collective leverage over AI development pace.

**Mechanism**:
- Identify nations controlling choke points: Netherlands (ASML lithography), Taiwan (TSMC fabrication), Japan (materials, equipment), US (design, some equipment), Germany (optics)
- Convene these nations to formalize coordination (possibly through Safe AI Forum or similar)
- Establish joint export control frameworks
- Create shared monitoring of chip flows to non-allied nations
- Use supply chain leverage as enforcement mechanism for future AI treaties

**Why supply chain vs. other leverage points**: Most AI governance has no enforcement mechanism. Supply chain control is one of the few concrete chokepoints where rules can actually be enforced.

## Why it matters
- Semiconductor supply chain is geographically concentrated, providing rare governance opportunity
- Countries controlling chip manufacturing have significant but currently uncoordinated leverage
- Provides technical foundation for enforceable international AI agreements
- Can respond to detected threats by restricting chip access

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: No clear institutional convener; competing economic interests between nations; potential conflict with existing export control regimes; China developing domestic alternatives

## Who's working on it
- **Safe AI Forum (SAIF)**: Mentioned as potential organizer
- **Think tanks**: Policy research on supply chain leverage
