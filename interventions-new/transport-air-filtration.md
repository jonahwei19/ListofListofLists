# Transport air filtration

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Apply indoor air quality principles to large vehicles like aircraft and cruise ships. Environmental controls to reduce pathogen transmission during travel. Includes HEPA filtration upgrades, increased air exchange rates, and potentially UV disinfection systems adapted for vehicle environments.

## Why it matters
- Travel is a key vector for pandemic spread
- Reducing transmission in aircraft could slow international spread of novel pathogens
- Enclosed vehicles create high-risk transmission environments similar to buildings
- Ships and cruise vessels have been pandemic amplifiers historically

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Weight and power constraints on aircraft; retrofit costs; coordination with vehicle manufacturers and operators; regulatory requirements across jurisdictions

## Who's working on it
- Not specified (aircraft manufacturers have existing HEPA systems; cruise industry has updated protocols post-COVID)
