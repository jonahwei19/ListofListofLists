# Biosafety lab modernization

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Modernize BSL-3/4 laboratory infrastructure to prevent accidental pathogen release. Technologies and systems maintaining biosafety in high-containment facilities have "remained decades old and slow to evolve." Includes physical containment systems, personnel safety equipment, decontamination procedures, and monitoring/detection systems for containment breaches.

## Why it matters
- Lab accidents are a distinct pathway for pandemic-capable pathogens to reach the public
- Separate from natural emergence or deliberate release scenarios
- Reduces proliferation risk (pathogens escaping containment) rather than just post-release response
- Growing number of BSL-3/4 labs worldwide increases cumulative accident risk

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: High retrofit costs for existing facilities; regulatory inertia; limited R&D investment in next-generation containment; coordination across international facilities with different standards

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
