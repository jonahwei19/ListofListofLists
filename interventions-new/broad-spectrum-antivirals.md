# Broad-spectrum antivirals

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Develop and stockpile antiviral drugs that work against entire virus families rather than single pathogens. Approaches include: targeting conserved viral mechanisms shared across families (polymerases, proteases), host-directed therapies that target human cell pathways viruses depend on, and platform therapeutics that can be rapidly adapted to new threats. Goal is treatments available off-the-shelf for any pathogen class.

## Why it matters
- Vaccines take time; treatments provide immediate defense for the infected
- Novel and engineered pathogens may evade pathogen-specific drugs
- Host-directed therapies sidestep viral evolution and resistance
- For AI-enabled bioweapons designed to evade specific countermeasures, broad-spectrum approaches are the fallback

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Limited FDA-approved broad-spectrum antivirals exist; drug development timelines; proving efficacy against pathogens that don't yet exist; stockpiling costs for drugs with limited peacetime demand

## Who's working on it
- **Various pharmaceutical companies**: Limited commercial interest due to uncertain market
- **Academic groups**: Host-directed antiviral research
- **Government programs**: BARDA pandemic preparedness stockpiling
