# Government official AI awareness campaigns

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Targeted social media and direct campaigns delivering AI progress evidence and risk scenarios to officials who control critical chokepoints.

**Mechanism**:
- Identify officials with authority over critical AI-related decisions (permits, approvals, authorizations)
- Target their information channels: professional social media, industry events, trusted publications
- Deliver evidence of AI capability advancement and risk scenarios
- Focus on officials who could delay approvals for AI infrastructure expansion through administrative processes
- Include military officials who control defense AI decisions
- Use demonstrated capability evidence, not just abstract arguments

**Why government officials specifically**: Officials control regulatory chokepoints (permits, environmental review, infrastructure approval) that can slow AI development through legitimate administrative processes.

## Why it matters
- Government/military officials control critical chokepoints but may be unaware of AI risks
- Administrative decisions (permits, approvals) can slow AI infrastructure expansion
- Officials make decisions daily that affect AI development pace
- Many officials lack exposure to frontier AI capabilities

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Identifying officials with leverage; reaching them through trusted channels; avoiding backlash; measuring effectiveness

## Who's working on it
- **No systematic program identified**
