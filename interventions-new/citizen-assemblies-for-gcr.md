# Citizen assemblies for global catastrophic risks

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Convene representative groups of ordinary citizens who receive expert briefings and engage in extended deliberation on complex AI and catastrophic risk issues. Citizen assemblies distill complex ideas into implementable solutions while maintaining legitimacy through representative public involvement. The approach tends to produce outcomes with broader public acceptance than top-down expert decisions and could identify considerations that specialists overlook.

## Why it matters
- AI governance decisions made by small expert groups may lack democratic legitimacy
- Citizens may identify practical concerns and values that experts miss
- Broader acceptance of outcomes reduces implementation resistance

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Bottlenecks**: Citizen assembly methodology exists but not widely applied to AI/GCR topics; requires significant resources to convene properly; unclear how to integrate outputs into actual policy processes

## Who's working on it
- Not specified (citizen assembly methodology practiced by organizations like Sortition Foundation, but not specifically focused on AI/GCR)
