# Compute governance

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Using computational resources as a governance lever for AI development. Two complementary approaches:

**Compute caps**: Regulatory limits on computational resources available for AI training runs, typically expressed as FLOPS thresholds or power consumption limits at data centers. Enforcement mechanisms could include hardware-level throttling, licensing requirements for large training runs, or monitoring of power usage at frontier-capable facilities.

**Supply chain coordination**: Organize key nations in the AI compute supply chain (Netherlands, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, US) to recognize and coordinate their collective leverage over AI development pace. Control of specialized chips and manufacturing equipment provides one of the few concrete enforcement points for AI governance, creating practical leverage for any future AI treaties.

**Chip registry**: A complete database of AI chips above certain FLOP/s thresholds, tracking location and ownership globally. The US can begin using national technical means (intelligence community), then internationalize or cross-check with other nations' registries. Domestically, Section 705 of the DPA enables domestic accounting.

**Inference-only retrofitting**: Technical mechanisms and installation capacity to ensure data centers can be verified as not being used for training, only inference. This preserves economic value while enabling enforcement of compute limits or international agreements. Requires R&D to develop the retrofitting package, plus training thousands of vetted installers and auditors.

## Why it matters
- Directly slows capability advancement regardless of lab intentions
- Buys time for safety research to keep pace with capabilities
- The semiconductor supply chain is geographically concentrated, providing a rare governance chokepoint
- Countries controlling chip manufacturing have significant but currently uncoordinated leverage
- Addresses racing dynamics at infrastructure level rather than relying on voluntary restraint

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Enforcement mechanisms unclear; strong industry pushback expected; international coordination required to prevent regulatory arbitrage; competing economic interests; potential conflict with existing export control regimes; no clear institutional convener

## Who's working on it
- **Safe AI Forum (SAIF)**: Mentioned as potential organizer for supply chain coordination
