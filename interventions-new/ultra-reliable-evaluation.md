# Ultra-Reliable AI Evaluation

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Engineering approaches and benchmarking methodologies designed to achieve "five nines" (99.999%) reliability rather than the 99% accuracy typical of current AI benchmarks. The methods efficiently identify edge cases where models fail catastrophically without requiring millions of test instances, using adversarial probing modeled on aircraft safety standards rather than Kaggle competitions.

## Why it matters
- Critical systems (medical, infrastructure, autonomous vehicles) require reliability guarantees far beyond current benchmarks
- Current evaluation methods miss rare but catastrophic failure modes
- Without efficient methods to find rare failures, deploying AI in high-stakes domains remains unsafe
