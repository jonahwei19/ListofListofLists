# Training data anti-poisoning techniques

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Detection systems for suspicious data patterns, resilient training methodologies that maintain performance when portions of data are compromised, and recovery protocols for systems exposed to poisoned inputs. Requires coordination across security teams currently working in isolation on similar problems.

## Why it matters
- Data poisoning can create backdoors or biased outputs that evade standard testing
- Compromised behavior may only manifest in specific contexts
- Protects integrity of entire training pipeline

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Multiple security teams working in isolation; detection methods lag behind attack sophistication

## Who's working on it
- Multiple security teams (working in isolation)
