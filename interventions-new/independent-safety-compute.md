# Independent safety compute

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Dedicated computing infrastructure for AI security researchers outside frontier labs. Addresses risk that concentration of infrastructure creates barriers for researchers if lab access is revoked. Open-source models provide sufficient testing grounds for many safety approaches. Infrastructure coupled with governance mechanisms preventing misuse for capabilities research.

## Why it matters
- Safety researchers outside major labs lack compute access, limiting research scope
- If access depends on lab cooperation, it can be revoked
- Independent infrastructure ensures safety research continues regardless of lab decisions

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Funding for cluster; governance mechanisms to prevent capabilities misuse

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
