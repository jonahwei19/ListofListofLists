# AI-assisted infrastructure hardening

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
AI-assisted rewriting of critical infrastructure code with formal verification methods. Involves recruiting cybersecurity experts from Google, NSA, etc. to systematically harden national infrastructure. Includes early warning systems for unusual exploitation patterns, hardened systems resistant to automated attacks, and resilient backup capabilities.

## Why it matters
- Critical infrastructure runs decades-old code with unknown vulnerabilities
- AI-powered attacks could exploit these at scale
- Systematic hardening before attacks begin is more tractable than reactive patching

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Recruiting top security talent; legacy code complexity; verification at scale

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
