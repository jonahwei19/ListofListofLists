# Human Verification Systems

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Robust systems for verifying human identity to protect critical decision-making. Distinguishes human actors from AI systems in domains requiring human authorization. Systems would need continuous updates to counter increasingly sophisticated impersonation capabilities.

## Why it matters
- As AI impersonation becomes more sophisticated, distinguishing humans from AI in high-stakes decisions becomes critical
- Maintains human control in domains that require it
- Prevents AI systems from acquiring unauthorized access through impersonation

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires continuous updates as AI impersonation improves

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
