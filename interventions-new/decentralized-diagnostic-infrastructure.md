# Decentralized diagnostic infrastructure

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Build nationwide testing infrastructure that bypasses centralized laboratory bottlenecks. Key components: at-home diagnostic tests that don't require lab processing, point-of-care testing at pharmacies and clinics, and platform diagnostic technologies that can be rapidly adapted to new pathogens (requiring only the target sequence, not months of test development). Goal is nationwide testing capacity within days of detecting a new pathogen.

## Why it matters
- Testing determines who is infected, enabling isolation and contact tracing
- During COVID-19, centralized lab capacity was a bottleneck for months
- At-home and point-of-care testing removes lab throughput constraints entirely
- Platform approaches (like PCR with new primers) enable rapid adaptation to novel pathogens
- For engineered pathogens, rapid testing deployment is essential for containment

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Bottlenecks**: At-home test accuracy vs. lab tests; regulatory approval for rapid platform adaptation; distribution logistics; user compliance with self-testing; false positive management at population scale

## Who's working on it
- **Various diagnostics companies**: At-home COVID tests proved concept
- **Academic groups**: Platform diagnostic technologies
- **Government programs**: CDC, BARDA
