# Interactive model inspection tools

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Rich, interactive interfaces for exploring model behaviors through natural language queries ("Why did the model fail on this task?" "How would it perform with internet access?"). Dynamic dashboards for probing capabilities, investigating failures, and performing sensitivity analyses. AI-backed to scale with model capabilities, using specialized AI systems to interpret and explain frontier model behaviors.

## Why it matters
- Static benchmark scores hide critical information about when and how models fail
- Interactive tools let evaluators explore edge cases and discover risks benchmarks miss
- AI-backed inspection necessary because human evaluators can't keep up with volume and complexity
