# AI Crawling Standards

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Industry standards and technical solutions for managing how AI systems access and index web content. Addresses blocking unauthorized crawling, preventing data harvesting that violates creator intent, and establishing ethical norms for training data collection. Creates consensus around acceptable crawling practices, technical enforcement mechanisms, and potentially compensation models for content creators.

## Why it matters
- Without standards, data collection for training remains a free-for-all that ignores creator rights
- Undermines trust in AI systems
- Multiple groups taking independent action but lacking coordination

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Bottlenecks**: Several groups working independently without coordination

## Who's working on it
- Several groups (not specified)
