# Pandemic-resilient refuges

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Hardened facilities ("Mars on Earth") designed to preserve civilization-rebuilding capacity through extreme pandemics. Key capabilities beyond basic survival shelters: (1) pathogen testing at entry to maintain sterile internal environment, (2) self-contained life support allowing indefinite isolation, and (3) countermeasure development capacity—labs and equipment to develop vaccines/treatments from inside the refuge.

## Why it matters
- Most biosecurity measures aim to prevent catastrophe; refuges assume prevention might fail
- Pure survival bunkers delay extinction but don't enable recovery
- Refuges with countermeasure capacity can eventually emerge and "re-seed" the population
- Provides last-line defense against extinction-level engineered pandemics

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Massive capital cost; unclear governance (who gets in?); maintaining technical capacity for countermeasure development; avoiding cult/bunker mentality

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
