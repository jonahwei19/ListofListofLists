# Personalized AI risk scenarios

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
"Day After" scenarios that demonstrate AI risks in personally relatable terms for specific audiences.

**Mechanism**:
- Develop scenarios tailored to specific audiences (investors, parents, executives, etc.)
- Show how AI risks affect things they personally care about (their children's futures, their investments, their industry)
- Similar to nuclear "Day After" scenarios that made abstract risk tangible
- Test scenarios for emotional impact without manipulation
- Create materials that advocates can use in targeted conversations

**Why personalized vs. generic**: Abstract AI risk narratives don't motivate action. Showing how risks affect what someone personally cares about creates urgency.

## Why it matters
- Abstract risk narratives fail to motivate action
- Personal stakes create urgency that statistics cannot
- Different audiences need different framings (investor scenarios differ from parent scenarios)
- "Day After" approach was effective for nuclear risk communication

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Scenario development; testing for effectiveness; avoiding manipulation or fearmongering; distribution channels

## Who's working on it
- **No dedicated organization identified**
