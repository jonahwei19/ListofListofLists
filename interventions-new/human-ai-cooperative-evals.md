# Human-AI cooperative evaluations

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Empirical research comparing human performance on tasks with and without AI assistance (and with varying AI systems). Establishes understanding of how humans might cause harm with AI that wouldn't be possible otherwise. Also provides information on productive human-AI integration.

## Why it matters
- Threat isn't just what AI can do alone, but what humans can do with AI assistance
- A model might not synthesize a pathogen, but might enable a human who couldn't before
- Understanding AI "uplift" of human capabilities is essential for assessing real-world risk
