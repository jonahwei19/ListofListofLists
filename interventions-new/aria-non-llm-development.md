# ARIA non-LLM development

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Expand support for the UK's Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA), particularly its work on hardware mechanisms and non-LLM-based agent development approaches. These represent alternatives to accelerating the LLM paradigm while still capturing economic benefits. The UK is also pioneering technical verification methods and engagement with China on AI safety that could serve as models for international coordination.

## Why it matters
- Alternative AI development paths may be safer than scaling current LLM approaches
- Hardware-based safety mechanisms could provide guarantees that software-only approaches cannot
- Demonstrates that safety and capability are not mutually exclusive

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Limited funding compared to LLM-focused efforts; unclear pathway to commercial viability; talent competition with better-funded LLM labs

## Who's working on it
- **ARIA**: Hardware mechanisms, non-LLM agent development
