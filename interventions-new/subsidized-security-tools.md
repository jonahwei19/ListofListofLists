# Government-subsidized cybersecurity AI tools

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Government procurement and distribution of advanced AI-powered bug-finding tools to critical infrastructure globally, prioritizing financial institutions (to prevent AI systems from acquiring funds). Treats cybersecurity as a public good, funding security improvements in countries that otherwise lack resources.

## Why it matters
- Security capabilities concentrate in wealthy organizations/nations
- Weak links become entry points for AI-enabled attacks
- Banks and financial institutions are priority targets (AI acquiring funds enables further operations)

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires government funding; international coordination for global deployment

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
