# AI risk narrative film

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
High-budget feature film about AI risks created with extensive input from alignment researchers, targeting mainstream audiences through compelling narrative.

**Mechanism**:
- Partner with established filmmaker (Ron Moore previously interested but didn't complete)
- Alignment researchers advise on technical accuracy
- Compelling narrative presents risks without appearing manipulative or preachy
- Avoids direct advertising framing in favor of genuine entertainment
- Reaches audiences who will never read technical papers or policy documents
- Creates cultural touchstone for discussing AI risks (like "The Day After" for nuclear war)

**Why film vs. documentary**: Fiction reaches wider audiences. Documentary audiences are self-selected. Compelling narratives create emotional understanding that reports cannot.

## Why it matters
- Cultural awareness makes policy action politically viable
- Reaches audiences outside technical/policy communities
- Creates shared reference point for discussing AI risks
- Single high-quality film can shift discourse (Dr. Strangelove, The Day After, Contagion)

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea (prior discussions didn't complete)
- **Prior interest**: Ron Moore (Battlestar Galactica) discussed but didn't progress
- **Bottlenecks**: Hollywood access; tens of millions in funding; finding filmmaker who understands technical content; balancing entertainment with accuracy

## Who's working on it
- **No active project identified**
