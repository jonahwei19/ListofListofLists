# Public Model Audits

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Independent organizations conduct comprehensive public audits of open-weight models using substantial compute resources. The audits demonstrate in public what thorough model analysis should look like, creating templates for what information should be available about any deployed AI system. Public process enables community feedback and establishes consensus on best practices.

## Why it matters
- Creates public precedents for robust evaluation that private labs cannot easily ignore
- Raises the floor for responsible disclosure without requiring immediate regulation
- Establishes community-vetted standards for model transparency
