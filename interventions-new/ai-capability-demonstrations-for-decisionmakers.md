# AI capability demonstrations for decision-makers

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Compelling live demonstrations of frontier AI capabilities for decision-makers who underestimate current technology.

**Mechanism**:
- Identify decision-makers with influence over AI policy who haven't experienced frontier models
- Provide hands-on demonstrations showing current capabilities (coding, reasoning, persuasion, etc.)
- Show both beneficial and potentially dangerous capabilities
- One-on-one or small group format for impact
- Many influential people remain unwilling to invest modest sums for closed model access and consequently fail to understand state of technology

**Why demonstrations vs. reports**: Experiencing AI capabilities firsthand creates understanding that reading about them cannot. Many decision-makers don't use frontier AI themselves.

## Why it matters
- Decision-makers who underestimate AI won't take governance seriously
- Abstract risk narratives don't motivate action; concrete demonstrations do
- Many influential people haven't experienced frontier model capabilities firsthand
- Creates informed stakeholders who can advocate internally

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea (ad hoc demonstrations happening, no systematic program)
- **Bottlenecks**: Access to decision-makers; demonstration design that shows capabilities without enabling misuse; scaling beyond individual meetings

## Who's working on it
- **Various advocates**: Ad hoc demonstrations, no systematic program
