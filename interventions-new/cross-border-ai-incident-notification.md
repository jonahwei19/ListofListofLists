# Cross-border AI incident notification

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Develop mechanisms for countries to alert each other about out-of-control AI systems, similar to "red phones" during the Cold War. This addresses the critical need for international communication channels during AI safety incidents, preventing scenarios where one party has a solution to a technical problem but fails to share it due to lack of established communication protocols. The system would enable rapid information exchange to prevent misunderstandings and enable coordinated responses.

## Why it matters
- Rapid communication during AI safety crises could be the difference between containment and catastrophe
- Countries may fail to share critical information without pre-established channels
- Actions during a crisis may be misinterpreted without clear communication, risking escalation

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires diplomatic agreements; security concerns about information sharing; no clear institutional home; trust deficits between major powers

## Who's working on it
- **OECD**: Working on related mechanisms
