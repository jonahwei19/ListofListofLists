# Government AI capacity

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Building government capacity for AI oversight through two complementary approaches:

**Expertise centers**: Trusted expertise centers embedded within government and international institutions to provide ongoing education on AI capabilities and implications. Delivers authoritative briefings on emerging capabilities and sectoral impacts, creating informed decision-making capacity that keeps pace with rapid technological change.

**Talent placement**: Placing a thousand competent, mission-aligned experts in government positions globally to improve the talent pool in AI governance. Strategic talent allocation across critical agencies like the EU AI Office, various AI Safety Institutes, and other regulatory bodies. Focus on enhancing government capabilities from within, ensuring regulators have both technical understanding and motivation to implement oversight.

**Legislative oversight structures**: Dedicated Congressional/parliamentary committees focused on AGI. A Joint Select Committee on AGI would bring together informed legislators, allow subpoenas and classified hearings, and provide AGI-focused staff. Addresses the current situation where very few legislators understand AI capabilities trajectories or have staff capable of advising on AI strategy.

## Why it matters
- Policymakers can't regulate what they don't understand
- Government capacity to regulate AI is constrained by lack of technical expertise
- Embedded expertise enables informed rather than reactive governance
- Internal expertise enables better policy design and implementation

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot (expertise centers), Idea (large-scale talent placement)
- **Bottlenecks**: Recruiting credible experts willing to work in government; maintaining independence from lab capture; identifying and recruiting candidates at scale
