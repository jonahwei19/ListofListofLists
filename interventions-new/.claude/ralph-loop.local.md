OK Claude. You are to continue. This can be better. Go through all the overviews in the algorithm that we outlined, enrich them with internet searching, make them precise. Think hard. Merge any duplicates. Keep a running list of any new lists you pick up when searching through (maybe in a file like next lists) that is in your ToDos as a thing to pull from). COntinue. Think. Be precise and correct and nuanced. More lists. Within scope. make this useful. Remember that you are never to read large PDFs yourself. You must get sub agents to convert them to markdown, and rely on good sub-agent systemprompting for specific intervention creation. Keep your context clean claude.
