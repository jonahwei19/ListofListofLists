# AI Misuse Detection Systems

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Systems to identify and address AI misuse before "mini-catastrophes" such as market manipulation, coordinated influence operations, or novel cyberattack patterns. Technical infrastructure monitors usage patterns across AI ecosystems, flagging suspicious activity, indications of weaponization, and proactive checks for anomalous AI behavior in the wild. Requires both technical detection mechanisms and human evaluation processes to distinguish genuine innovations from potential threats.

## Why it matters
- Functions as safety net for catching misuse scenarios not anticipated in initial evaluations
- Brings concrete evidence of risks to light sooner, potentially motivating political action before severe incidents
- Catches "mini-catastrophes" before they become major ones
