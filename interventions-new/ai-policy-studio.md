# AI policy studio

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Create a dedicated policy innovation hub that drafts specific legislation, regulations, and governance frameworks for AI safety, alongside clear explainers of what each policy is trying to accomplish. The studio would address the problem of existing policy proposals being "too nebulous" by producing concrete, implementable text. It would also conduct post-mortems on regulatory failures (like SB 1047) to identify implementation pitfalls before they recur in future legislation.

## Why it matters
- Current AI policy proposals are often too vague to be actionable
- Past regulatory failures suggest need for more careful policy design
- Clear explainers help build public and legislative support for complex technical policies

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires combination of legal drafting expertise and technical AI knowledge; no clear funding pathway; existing think tanks may not have sufficient technical depth

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
