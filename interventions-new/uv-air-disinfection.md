# UV air disinfection

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Deploy ultraviolet light for continuous air disinfection in occupied spaces through two complementary approaches:

**Far-UVC (222nm)**: Filtered krypton-chloride excimer lamps at 222nm wavelength. Unlike conventional 254nm UV-C (exposure limit: 6 mJ/cm²), Far-UVC has much higher safe exposure limits (ACGIH 2025: 161 mJ/cm² for eyes, 479 mJ/cm² for skin over 8-hour exposure) because the wavelength is absorbed by the outer dead layer of skin and tear film before reaching living cells. Can be directed throughout the room including at occupant level.

**Upper-room UV (254nm)**: Ceiling-mounted fixtures using conventional 254nm UV directed at upper room air while occupants remain safely below. Achieves safety through spatial design rather than wavelength selection. Established technology with decades of evidence, currently under-deployed.

Both approaches provide continuous passive disinfection against bacteria, viruses, and fungi without pathogen-specific targeting.

## Why it matters
- Passive defense that does not require pathogen identification—eliminates pathogens regardless of whether they're known or engineered
- Works against any airborne threat including novel or vaccine-evading pathogens
- Far-UVC achieved 99.8% reduction of airborne infectious virus in occupied rooms (2024 study)
- Upper-room UV is deployable now without waiting for Far-UVC regulatory approval

## Current state
- **Status**: Research/Pilot (Far-UVC), Deployment (Upper-room)
- **Bottlenecks**:
  - Far-UVC: Regulatory approval for widespread occupied-space use; production scaling for cost reduction; ozone generation requires adequate ventilation; long-term exposure studies ongoing
  - Upper-room: Installation costs; building owner awareness; maintenance requirements; incorrect installation reducing effectiveness
- **Recent progress (2024-2025)**:
  - 3-year eye safety study showed no damage in workers under daily Far-UVC exposure (Sugihara et al., 2024)
  - 2024 room study: 99.8% airborne virus reduction (murine norovirus) within regulatory limits
  - 2025 corneal model study confirmed Far-UVC effects limited to outermost layers, no damage to regenerative cells
  - LED development: 10% wall-plug efficiency prototypes scheduled for autumn 2025, commercial devices expected 2027
  - 2025 safety review: "high ability" pathogen kill rate, "high level of safety," long-term studies continue

## Who's working on it
- **UV Medico**: Commercial Far-UVC fixtures
- **Columbia University (David Brenner lab)**: Foundational Far-UVC safety research
- **Far UV Technologies**: Commercial Far-UVC deployment
- **CDC**: Upper-room UV guidelines and research
- Multiple academic groups validating efficacy and safety
