# WHO-style AI governance forum

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
International forum for AI governance with universal membership (unlike current Frontier Model Forum which excludes key players), focused on treaty development and red line enforcement.

**Mechanism**:
- Universal membership: all major AI developers, including DeepSeek, xAI, Chinese labs (unlike exclusive membership in current forums)
- Large-scale funding (hundreds of millions USD) for evaluation organizations like METR
- Focus on international treaty development (biological weapons uplift, autonomous weapons, etc.)
- Red line definition and enforcement before critical thresholds crossed
- WHO model: technical guidance, information sharing, early warning, coordinated response

**Why WHO model**: WHO succeeds despite geopolitical tensions by focusing on shared threats. AI risks (pandemics, weapons) similarly affect all nations.

## Why it matters
- Current Frontier Model Forum excludes key players (DeepSeek, xAI), limiting effectiveness
- Competitive dynamics accelerate development while undermining safety
- Universal participation prevents race-to-the-bottom on safety
- Treaty development requires forum where all parties can negotiate

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Existing forums**: Frontier Model Forum (limited membership), OECD AI Policy Observatory (limited mandate)
- **Bottlenecks**: Geopolitical tensions (especially US-China); funding at required scale; governance structure unclear; convincing labs to join universal forum

## Who's working on it
- **METR**: Proposed recipient of expanded funding
- **Frontier Model Forum**: Existing but limited version
