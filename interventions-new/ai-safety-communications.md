# AI safety communications infrastructure

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Specialized communications capacity for AI safety organizations. Two complementary components:

**Communications consultancy**: A firm specializing in AI safety communications—media training for researchers, op-ed placement, messaging framework development, and crisis communications support. Unlike generic PR firms, would understand technical nuances and policy context specific to AI safety.

**Knowledge synthesis**: Continuously updated expert syntheses ("living literature reviews") on key topics like scheming/deception risks, policy research agendas, alignment approaches. Addresses the gap between academic research pace and policymaker information needs. Maintained by domain experts rather than one-time reports.

## Why it matters
- Safety organizations often lack communications capacity to effectively reach policymakers and public
- Technical researchers rarely trained in effective public communication
- Generic communications firms don't understand AI safety context and nuances
- Policy windows open and close faster than traditional academic publication cycles
- Policymakers need accessible, up-to-date syntheses rather than scattered papers

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Finding staff with both communications expertise and AI safety understanding; sustainable funding models; maintaining neutrality while being effective advocates

## Who's working on it
