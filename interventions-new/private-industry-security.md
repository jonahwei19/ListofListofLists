# Private Industry Security Organization

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
A privately-funded alternative to the chronically underfunded Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS, $15M budget) focusing on GPU distribution oversight and AI research automation monitoring. The entity would prototype advanced data center surveillance, implement GPU tracking systems, and establish protocols for questioning companies about research automation capabilities. Design principle: create "proposals that are hard and awkward to oppose" to maximize political viability.

## Why it matters
- Current government oversight capacity is dramatically underfunded relative to the challenge
- Private alternative can move faster and be better resourced than government agencies
- Fills critical gap in enforcement and monitoring infrastructure

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Not specified

## Who's working on it
