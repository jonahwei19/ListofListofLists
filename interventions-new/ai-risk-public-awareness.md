# AI risk public awareness

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Comprehensive public communications strategy to shape understanding of AI risks and build political will for governance measures. Four complementary approaches:

**Feature film**: High-budget film about AI risks with extensive input from alignment researchers, targeting mainstream audiences. Avoids direct advertising in favor of compelling narrative that faithfully presents technical realities without appearing manipulative. Previous discussions with TV producers like Ron Moore occurred but didn't progress to completion.

**Mass media campaign**: Large-scale communications with substantial funding ($50-250M annually, comparable to corporate communications budgets). Combines proactive messaging about AI safety needs and counter-campaigns opposing anti-regulation efforts. Must avoid partisan capture to preserve bipartisan governance paths.

**Capability demonstrations**: Compelling demonstrations of frontier AI capabilities for decision-makers who underestimate current technology. Many influential people remain unwilling to invest modest sums for closed model access and consequently fail to understand the state of the technology.

**Personalized risk scenarios**: "Day After" scenarios that tangibly demonstrate AI risks in personally relatable terms (e.g., scenarios where children's funds are threatened). Addresses the problem that abstract risk narratives don't motivate action.

## Why it matters
- Mass media shapes public perception more than expert reports
- AI safety messaging is drastically outspent by pro-industry communications
- Cultural awareness makes policy action politically viable (as with climate change, nuclear war)
- Decision-makers who underestimate AI won't take governance seriously
- Reaches audiences who will never read technical papers

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Funding at scale ($50-250M for media campaigns; tens of millions for film); Hollywood access; campaign strategy expertise; avoiding partisan framing; creating scenarios that resonate without seeming manipulative

## Who's working on it
- **Ron Moore**: Prior film discussions (incomplete)
