# Government risk framework expansion

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Persuade governments to incorporate AI-driven catastrophic scenarios into official national risk assessments. Currently, most national risk frameworks focus exclusively on conventional threats (floods, earthquakes, terrorism) and systematically exclude emerging technological risks. These assessments directly determine infrastructure investment, research funding, and emergency preparedness resource allocation. Engaging government risk assessment agencies could redirect existing preparedness funding toward AI-relevant measures.

## Why it matters
- Government risk frameworks determine where billions of preparedness dollars flow
- AI catastrophic risks remain systematically underfunded compared to natural disasters because they are not in official frameworks
- Including AI risks legitimizes preparedness spending and creates institutional accountability

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Lack of established methodology for quantifying AI catastrophic risk in standard risk assessment formats; no clear advocacy pathway to risk assessment agencies

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
