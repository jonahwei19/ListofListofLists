# AI-catastrophe backup planning

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Contingency plans integrating local food systems, infrastructure, political contexts, and population needs for maintaining essential services during AI-catalyzed catastrophes (nuclear conflict, EMP, infrastructure collapse). Differs from general resilience planning by focusing specifically on scenarios where AI integration into critical systems (especially military command) creates new failure pathways. Infrastructure collapse following high-altitude EMPs would disrupt food systems within weeks.

## Why it matters
- AI integration into nuclear command creates novel catastrophic risk pathways
- Pre-positioned plans enable faster recovery than ad-hoc responses
- Food system disruption cascades into societal collapse within weeks

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires detailed modeling of AI-specific failure modes

## Who's working on it
- **ALLFED**: Related work on alternative foods and resilience (but not AI-specific)
