# International AI deal preparation

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Building the institutional, political, and technical capacity to verify international agreements on AI development before such agreements are urgently needed. Rather than waiting for crisis conditions to negotiate, this approach develops verification mechanisms and diplomatic frameworks in advance.

Key components:

**Verification mechanism development**: Technical and institutional capacity to verify that parties to an agreement (particularly US and China) are not training models beyond agreed thresholds. This includes chip tracking, on-chip monitoring mechanisms, and international chip registries that can be cross-checked.

**Diplomatic groundwork**: Maintaining communication channels between key governments, engaging in Track 1 and Track 1.5 dialogue on AI, and building mutual understanding of each party's concerns and red lines before high-stakes negotiations.

**Initial agreement frameworks**: Start with narrow, verifiable agreements that lay groundwork for future deals—for example, mutual transparency for AI progress and verification on large datacenters. These build trust and establish precedents without immediately limiting either side strategically.

## Why it matters
- Delays make verification harder: China indigenizes its chip supply chain, more compute enters the world
- Without pre-positioned verification capacity, any agreement will be harder to enforce
- Crisis-time negotiations happen under worse conditions with degraded information environments
- Small upfront investment in verification capacity could widen the bargaining range for future deals
- Avoids the three terrible alternatives: racing to ASI with handoff, sabotaging adversaries, or no coordination at all

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Political will in both US and China; geopolitical tensions make cooperation difficult; technical challenges of reliable verification; domestic opposition to any perceived constraints on AI development
