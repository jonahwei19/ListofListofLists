# Targeted AI governance stakeholder outreach

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Identifying and reaching constituents who impact critical AI decisions with tested, targeted messages through appropriate channels.

**Mechanism**:
- Identify high-leverage stakeholders: investors in AI companies, board members, key legislators, regulatory officials
- Map their communication channels and information sources
- Test messages for effectiveness before deployment (marketing-style A/B testing)
- Deliver through channels they trust (industry publications, peer networks, trusted advisors)
- Far more resource-efficient than mass campaigns—shifts decisions at critical leverage points
- Track and measure impact on actual decisions

**Why targeted vs. mass**: Broad public campaigns are expensive and diffuse. A single investor or board member may have more influence than millions of voters on specific AI decisions.

## Why it matters
- Critical AI decisions made by small number of people (board votes, investment decisions, regulatory choices)
- Mass campaigns expensive and may not reach decision-makers
- Targeted outreach concentrates resources on highest-leverage individuals
- Marketing expertise enables message optimization before major spend

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Identifying decision-makers with leverage; message testing; avoiding backlash; sustained tracking

## Who's working on it
- **No systematic program identified**
