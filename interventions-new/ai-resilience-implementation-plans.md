# AI resilience implementation plans

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Comprehensive, shovel-ready implementation blueprints for deploying large-scale AI safety funding. Detailed program structures, intervention taxonomies, organizational forms, and specific proposals that could be funded immediately if resources became available at scale ($1-10B+).

The goal is pre-positioning: having concrete, vetted plans ready so that funding windows (whether from governments, philanthropy, or other sources) can be utilized immediately rather than requiring months of planning after resources arrive.

## Why it matters
- Funding windows for AI safety may open suddenly (policy shifts, crises, philanthropic decisions)
- Without ready plans, large resources may be deployed poorly or slowly
- Current landscape lacks systematic assessment of what's shovel-ready vs. what requires development
- Coordination failure: funders don't know what to fund at scale, researchers don't know what's fundable

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires extensive coordination across organizations to identify priorities; plans must be kept current as landscape evolves; risk of plans becoming advocacy documents rather than implementation guides

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
