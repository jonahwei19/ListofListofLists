# BWC verification mechanisms

**Tag**: Policy

## What it is
Strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention through verification mechanisms, whistleblower protections and incentives, and open-source monitoring of biological research activities. Unlike the Chemical Weapons Convention which has inspection provisions, the current BWC lacks verification mechanisms. This would add: inspection regimes for dual-use facilities, financial incentives for whistleblowers in bio programs, and systematic monitoring of published biological research for concerning patterns.

## Why it matters
- BWC currently unverifiable—states can violate without detection
- Verification creates deterrence; whistleblower incentives enable detection from inside programs
- Targets proliferation step (preventing dangerous capabilities from reaching bad actors) rather than just response after attack

## Current state
- **Status**: Policy advocacy
- **Bottlenecks**: National sovereignty concerns over inspections; difficulty distinguishing defensive from offensive research; international consensus needed; verification regime design

## Who's working on it
- Various arms control organizations
- Academic groups focused on biosecurity governance
