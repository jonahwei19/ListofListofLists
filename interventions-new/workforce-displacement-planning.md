# Workforce displacement response planning

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Coordinated frameworks for identifying vulnerable sectors, quantifying displacement timelines, and deploying retraining programs before mass job loss occurs. The approach brings together government agencies, educational institutions, industry, and labor organizations to create sector-specific transition plans. Analysis suggests large-scale displacement risk within 3 years, with K-curve inequality effects potentially accelerating within 18 months.

## Why it matters
- Social safety nets could fail faster than institutions can respond
- Political backlash from unmanaged displacement undermines AI governance capacity
- Early identification enables targeted interventions in vulnerable sectors

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires multi-stakeholder coordination; no clear institutional home

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
