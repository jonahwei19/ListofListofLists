# Secure AI facilities

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
High-security infrastructure for frontier AI development, testing, and government oversight. Two complementary components:

**Frontier-grade data centers (SL4-SL5)**: Data centers meeting SL4-SL5 security standards for frontier AI development. SL4 provides SCIF-level security (Secure Compartmentalized Information Facilities) with confidential computing and Hardware Security Modules. SL5 goes further, designed to resist "top-priority operations by the world's most capable nation-state actors." Pilots are needed to develop practical SL5 protocols while reducing operational costs.

**Government AI facilities**: Secure government data centers capable of hosting model weights and other sensitive AI assets. Serve as repositories for models deemed too dangerous for widespread distribution, or as platforms for government auditing and independent safety testing. Access protocols could be tied to government procurement contracts, creating market-based incentives for compliance with safety metrics.

## Why it matters
- Frontier AI systems may become nation-state targets requiring maximum security
- No secure government infrastructure currently exists for holding dangerous AI models
- Governments cannot independently verify safety claims without their own testing facilities
- Lab automation feedback loops become dangerous as AI improves at AI research
- Prevents catastrophic model/weight leaks and potential containment failures

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: High operational costs for SL5; unclear what SL5 means practically for AI systems; scaling SCIF-level security to frontier AI energy requirements; large capital expenditure; security clearance and classification issues; potential resistance from labs concerned about IP protection
