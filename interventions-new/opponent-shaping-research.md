# Opponent shaping for AI systems

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
AI systems designed to shape other agents' learning and behavior toward mutually beneficial outcomes, rather than just optimizing against their strategies. Decentralized approach that de-escalates conflicts without requiring control over other agents' design or universal rules.

## Why it matters
- Optimizing against opponents creates arms races and destructive equilibria
- Offers path to stable, cooperative outcomes without centralized control
- Doesn't require universal agreement on rules

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Theoretical foundations; verification that shaping produces intended outcomes; deployment without bad actors exploiting it

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
