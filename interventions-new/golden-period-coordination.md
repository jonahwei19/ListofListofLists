# Safe AI productivity window extension

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Metrics and monitoring systems to detect when AI capabilities reach a 10-100x productivity enhancement threshold without compromising security. Coordination mechanisms to extend this window from weeks to months, allowing humanity to maximize benefits from relatively safe systems before advancing to potentially riskier models. Strategy frameworks for optimal exploitation of this window.

## Why it matters
- There may be a limited window where AI provides substantial benefits with manageable risks
- Without deliberate coordination, this window could be cut short by racing dynamics
- Identifying the window enables strategic planning for its use
