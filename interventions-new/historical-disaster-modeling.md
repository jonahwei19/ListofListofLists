# Historical disaster analogy modeling

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Detailed modeling of contemporary impacts from historical disasters to make abstract AI risks comprehensible. Example: simulating how a present-day Tambora eruption (1815-16 "Year Without Summer") would affect modern society. Provides concrete reference points for understanding potential AI disruption scenarios.

## Why it matters
- Policymakers struggle with unprecedented risks
- Historical analogies translate abstract scenarios into familiar mental models
- Detailed simulations make risks concrete and actionable

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Modeling expertise; selecting relevant historical analogies; communicating results accessibly

## Who's working on it
