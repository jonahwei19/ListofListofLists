# Accelerated vulnerability patching systems

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Enhanced mechanisms for rapid vulnerability identification, disclosure, and patching across critical infrastructure before AI systems can exploit them. Includes incentive structures for disclosure, automated detection of security gaps, and faster patch deployment pipelines.

## Why it matters
- AI could dramatically accelerate vulnerability discovery and exploitation
- Defensive patching cycles must keep pace with AI-powered offensive capabilities
- Better disclosure incentives surface vulnerabilities before adversaries find them

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Bottlenecks**: Coordination across organizations; disclosure incentive design

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
