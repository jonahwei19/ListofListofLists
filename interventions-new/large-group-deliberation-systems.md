# Large group deliberation systems

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Develop systems for collective decision-making involving large groups of people to maintain distributed power as AI advances rapidly. These tools should be tested extensively with real humans to iteratively improve understanding of effective processes, enabling people to be engaged quickly and efficiently when important decisions arise rather than defaulting to concentrated power. The goal is creating scalable democratic input mechanisms that can operate on relevant timescales.

## Why it matters
- Important AI governance decisions may need to be made quickly but should reflect broad input
- Without effective large-group deliberation, the choice is between slow democratic processes and fast autocratic decisions
- Scalable deliberation could enable democratic legitimacy without sacrificing response speed

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Balancing speed with quality of deliberation; ensuring representative participation; preventing manipulation; integrating outputs into actual decision processes

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
