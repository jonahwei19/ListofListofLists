# Attack scenario wargaming

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Professional wargaming exercises that model plausible catastrophic AI scenarios with key stakeholders, creating evidence-based threat analyses to ground policy discourse. The goal is reaching the 500-1,000 decision-makers who need shared understanding of realistic risks, rather than allowing discussion to veer toward unlikely extremes (preemptive nuclear strikes) or dismissive memes.

## Why it matters
- Public discourse defaults to sci-fi extremes or dismissal without grounded analysis
- Key decision-makers need shared mental models to coordinate responses
- Threat models enable proportionate rather than reactive policy

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires convening power and credibility with diverse stakeholders

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
