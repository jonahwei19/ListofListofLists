# Safety technique meta-research

**Tag**: Science

## What it is
Research evaluating and validating effectiveness of different AI safety approaches. Multiple independent actors assess the same models using different techniques, comparing results to determine reliability and blind spots. Moves alignment from piecemeal theoretical approaches toward empirical safety science with repeatable, testable methodologies that scale with capabilities.

## Why it matters
- We don't actually know which safety techniques work
- Different groups use different methods and report different results with no systematic comparison
- Meta-research identifies which techniques are actually effective rather than just theoretically promising

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Coordination across independent research groups

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
