# AI intervention jurisdiction framework

**Tag**: Society

## What it is
Develop clear frameworks specifying which government agencies have jurisdiction and authority to intervene in dangerous AI development. In the US, different agencies (DOD, DOE, etc.) would approach control very differently, making pre-crisis determination crucial. The project would address who should be involved in oversight (Congress, public, international allies), produce ranked intervention plans balancing effectiveness with checks on power, and challenge current defaults that may favor excessive exclusion from decision-making.

## Why it matters
- Unclear jurisdiction during a crisis could cause paralysis or conflicting responses
- Pre-established authority enables rapid, coordinated action when needed
- Current defaults may inappropriately exclude oversight bodies from decisions

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Bottlenecks**: Requires legal expertise on existing agency authorities; politically sensitive (agencies may resist clarity that limits their authority); no obvious institutional home for this work

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
