# Transmissible vaccines

**Tag**: Security

## What it is
Develop self-spreading vaccines that transmit between hosts like normal viruses, providing population-level immunity without requiring individual vaccination. This physical security approach constrains biological threats at the material level rather than through software-based solutions. Requires funding for experts who take near-future AI capabilities seriously and investment in research that goes beyond current biological literature to address qualitatively different threats than anything seen before.

## Why it matters
- Software controls can be bypassed; physical constraints on biological materials are harder to circumvent
- Could provide defense against sophisticated AI-enabled biological attacks
- Addresses scenarios where traditional vaccination campaigns cannot keep pace with fast-spreading engineered pathogens

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Bottlenecks**: Biosafety and regulatory challenges; ethical concerns about non-consensual biological intervention; technical difficulty of controlling spread dynamics; dual-use concerns

## Who's working on it
- Not specified
