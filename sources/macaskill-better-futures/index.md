## Essays

| Essay | Key Contribution |
|-------|------------------|
| Better Futures | Core S×F framework (Expected Value = Survival × Flourishing) |
| No Easy Eutopia | "Multiplicative model" - failure on any dimension loses most value |
| How to Make the Future Better | Tractability analysis for flourishing work |
| Persistent Path-Dependence | Why early decisions (especially AI) may lock in permanently |
| Supplement the basic case for better futures | Additional arguments and objections |
| Convergence and Compromise | Whether moral progress is natural or requires intervention |

## Key Ideas

**S×F Framework**: Even if survival probability is 80%, flourishing (capturing near-best outcomes) might be 10%. Solving flourishing could capture 36× more value than solving survival. Used to justify Flourishing as a category.

**No Easy Eutopia**: Good futures require getting many things right. A "common-sense utopia" (everyone happy and free) might still capture only a fraction of what's possible. This informs the "handle with care" warning on Flourishing.

**Path Dependence**: AI enables lock-in that wasn't previously possible. Early decisions about AI values, digital being treatment, space governance may become permanent. Justifies urgency on Flourishing work.

**Convergence Skepticism**: Historical moral progress doesn't guarantee future progress. Post-AI world may not have the mechanisms (interdependence, exposure to diversity) that drove past improvement.

## Mapping to Categories

| Concept | Category | Usage |
|---------|----------|-------|
| S×F framework | Flourishing | Justifies category existence |
| Multiplicative model | Flourishing | Shapes "positive requirements" framing |
| Lock-in mechanisms | Lock-in, Flourishing | Shared concern, different angle |
| Value drift foreclosure | Flourishing | Key risk in "premature lock-in" |
| Digital being welfare | Flourishing | Specific requirement |
| Space governance | Flourishing | Specific requirement |

## Status

Fully integrated into tiling framework. Primary intellectual source for Flourishing category definition and framing.
