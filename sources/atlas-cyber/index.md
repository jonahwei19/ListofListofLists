# Atlas Cybersecurity Projects

**Source**: Excel file from Atlas / Convergent Research
**Date processed**: 2026-01-11
**Total items**: 22 projects

## Overview

Fundable cybersecurity projects. Convergent Research willing to house efforts, oversee contracts, or administer grants. Several scoped as FROs.

## Mapping to Entries

### AI Vulnerability Detection

| Project | Maps to | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Evals/benchmarks for vuln detection | [[automated-vulnerability-patching]] | Training infrastructure |
| Developer tools for AI vuln detection | [[automated-vulnerability-patching]] | Deployment |
| Increase AI tool usage in security orgs | [[automated-vulnerability-patching]] | Adoption |
| Tools for monitoring AI agents at scale | [[multi-agent-threat-monitoring]] | Already covered |

### Memory-Safe Languages

| Project | Maps to | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| FRO translating OSS to Rust | [[automated-vulnerability-patching]] | IFP "Great Refactor" |
| Alternative memory safety (CHERI, Fil-C) | [[formally-verified-software]] | Hardware-based approaches |

### Formal Verification

| Project | Maps to | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| SpecFRO: Better spec validation | [[formally-verified-software]] | Making formal verification cheaper |
| Evals for formal verification | [[formally-verified-software]] | Training infrastructure |

| Chip validation (hard) | [[hardware-enabled-governance]] | AI + imaging for chip inspection |

### De-Novo Hardware (out of scope)

| Project | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Compute-critical mineral refinement | Supply chain, not direct resilience |
| Re-onshoring manufacturing | Industrial policy |
| Open secure AI hardware | Infrastructure |
| Decentralizing power infrastructure | Grid resilience |

### Human Operators

| Project | Maps to | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Trustworthy DNS for people | [[human-verification-systems]] | Identity verification |
| Clippy-but-good | Out of scope | UX, not security |

### Recovery

| Project | Maps to | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Resilient Manufacturing FRO | [[backup-planning]] | "Restart kits" for supply chain failure |

## Key Insights

1. **Heavy overlap with existing entries**: Most projects fit under `automated-vulnerability-patching` or `formally-verified-software`

2. **IFP connection**: Several projects reference IFP proposals (Great Refactor, SL5 Sprint)

3. **FRO model**: Many projects scoped as Focused Research Organizations - a specific funding/org model worth noting

4. **Convergent Research as implementer**: They're positioned to house these efforts, useful to note in intervention pages

## New interventions

None needed - all map to existing entries. The projects are specific implementations of interventions we already have.

## Summary

22 projects, all map to existing intervention entries. Strong focus on:
- Automated vulnerability patching (AI-assisted)
- Formal verification (making it cheaper/faster)
- Secure hardware infrastructure (SL5 datacenters)

No new problems or interventions needed, but provides good implementer details for existing entries.
