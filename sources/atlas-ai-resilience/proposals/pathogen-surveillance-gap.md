## Quoted passage

> gap: Existing pathogen detection and surveillance systems lack the speed, coverage, and sensitivity needed to identify novel biological threats before widespread transmission

> claim: we need more focus on detection that's politically viable to achieve sufficient access and scale

> An organization should identify the most viable government organization that can provide sufficient funding and access, and develop a proposal for broad detection and rapid sequencing and analysis capabilities with/for that organization. This could be wastewater, high-traffic enclosed spaces, testing volunteers, an alternative, or some combination.

> claim: privately-deployable detection systems can provide coverage without requiring government coordination. This is a viable business

> An organization should identify the most viable business models based on contagion detection, rapid sequencing, and analysis capabilities, potentially leveraging financially aligned entities like the insurance industry. (This could be wastewater, high-traffic enclosed spaces, testing volunteers, an alternative, or some combination.)

> claim: privately-deployable detection systems can provide coverage without requiring government coordination. This must be philanthropically funded

> An organization should identify the most viable low-cost, volunteer-heavy strategy for contagion detection, rapid sequencing, and analysis capabilities with/for relevant philanthropic organizations. (This could be wastewater, high-traffic enclosed spaces, testing volunteers, an alternative, or some combination.)
