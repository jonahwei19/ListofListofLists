# AI-Enabled Power Centralization

## Quoted passage

> gap: Increasingly automation of policy or resource allocation decisions will centralize power to potentially a small number of centralized AI systems, supressing competition given network effects. (The values and preferences encoded in these systems will have been set by a small group of individuals without mechanisms for broad stakeholder input or market competition)

> claim: it is important for competition that there be a balance of power between multiple AI systems and providers

> we could find, design, or create mechanisms that would disincentivize emergence of a dominant monopolistic AI provider (possibly by artificially reducing first-mover advantage or network effects, or by lowering the barrier to entry for competitors)

> Notes: Relevant experts: David Krueger, Jan Kovit

> claim: each model can simulate and embody the preferences of many humans

> we need more and better evals for normative and subjective preferences (e.g. https://weval.org/) to incorporate wisdom of the crowds into each AI system
