# Verifiable AI Deployment

## Quoted passage

> gap: Technical alignment and/or control of AI could be solved, yet we still have challenges deploying technical AI governance (see here).

> claim: the hard part might be having confidence that our demands are actually being met by the AIs

> Develop cryptographic frameworks for verifiable compute tracking and licensing, enabling auditable compliance without centralized remote control of devices or privacy violations (a stretch goal could be flexheg). This should be a defense-in-depth solution that includes projects from the model security category

> Notes: CNAS, RAND, Caleb Withers, Jonathan Happel. Could include hardware that's valuable for security later (you have tons of appetite for slow-down, but you want) (e.g. you want something on your ethernet that tells you where your bits are going)
