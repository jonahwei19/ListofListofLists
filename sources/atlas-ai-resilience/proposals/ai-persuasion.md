## Quoted passage

> gap: AI systems are better than humans at persuading other humans (citation); this could lead to adversaries using AI to manipulate individuals or groups, or erode trust.

> claim: persuasion and manipulation risks are mitigated if the human knows they're speaking with an AI

> proactively draft well-considered laws that prevent AI systems from emulating or masquerading as humans to be passed if desired, rather than reactive laws that may be drafted hastily in the wake of a crisis
