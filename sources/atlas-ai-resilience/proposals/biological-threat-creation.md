# Preventing Novel Biological Threat Creation

## Quoted passage

> gap: Current biosecurity infrastructure lacks effective mechanisms to prevent creation of novel biological threats as enabling technologies (including AI-assisted design tools, AI biosciences uplift, gene synthesis, etc.) become more accessible

> claim: we can prevent pathogens from being created by focusing on firewalling hardware and/or suppliers

> Develop secure supply chain frameworks for gene synthesis, biological equipment, and key reagents, with verification protocols that allow authorized research access and enable coordination between multiple suppliers in ways that reasonably preserve privacy and IP constraints.

> claim: we need more focus on prevention, protection, and blocking transmission once pathogens are deployed

> Incentivize or fund the stockpiling of PPE, air filtration/sanitization mechanisms, and other devices to prevent transmission

> claim: international treaties can mitigate the risks of accidents and bioweapons

> An organization should be focused on strengthening the biological weapons convention through verification mechanisms, enhanced international cooperation, and coordination with commercial providers like AI companies.
