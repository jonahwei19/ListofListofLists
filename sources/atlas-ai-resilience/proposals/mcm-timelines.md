## Quoted passage

> gap: Medical countermeasure development and deployment timelines are inadequate for responding to rapidly-emerging biological threats by over an order of magnitude

> claim: new, broadly accessible medical countermeasures (e.g. better immune response) are necessary for sufficient generality

> Someone should establish research programs (at ARPA-H, ARIA, or similar) focused on platform technologies for rapid vaccine/therapeutic development and adaptive immune enhancement that can be deployed preemptively/preventatively

> Notes: https://www.aria.org.uk/opportunity-spaces/sculpting-innate-immunity

> claim: rapidly deployable, customized medical countermeasures (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) should be used aganst future threats given their higher technological readiness

> Someone should establish high-speed development and distribution programs focused on shortening the timeline from detection to distribution at scale for novel pathogens.
