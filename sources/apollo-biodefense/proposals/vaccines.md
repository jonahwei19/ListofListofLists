## Quoted passages

From Apollo Executive Summary:
> The Apollo Program for Biodefense would provide the United States the opportunity to mobilize the nation and lead the world to meet these challenges: a world where... vaccine development and rollout occur in weeks rather than years; and where pandemics will never again threaten the lives and livelihoods of Americans and people around the world.

From Apollo Technology Priority #1 (Vaccine Candidates for Prototype Pathogens):
> Vaccine development is a time-consuming endeavor that has traditionally taken several decades per pathogen. Advances in many fields have enabled new approaches to vaccine development with much shorter timelines. However, even with these innovations, vaccine development is a multi-step process that takes precious time.
>
> Fortunately, vaccine development for one pathogen is often translatable to other pathogens in the same viral family. Thus, **by investing in vaccines for at least one prototype pathogen in each of the 25 viral families known to infect humans**, we could reduce the global burden of infectious disease while simultaneously preparing for the next unknown biological threat.

From Apollo Technology Priority #3 (Flexible and Scalable Manufacturing):
> These leading vaccine candidates largely rely on **platform technologies** (i.e., technologies that use the same processes for manufacturing, formulation, and delivery of a drug or vaccine against multiple different pathogens). Such platform technologies typically involve genetically encoding the therapeutic or vaccine candidate in mRNA, DNA, or a viral vector, enabling the production of different therapeutic or vaccine candidates simply by changing a genetic sequence.
>
> With enough investment in their maturation, platform technologies might eventually become well-established as a means of producing pharmaceutical products during and between pandemics, ensuring that we would always have a large, manufacturing base that could be rapidly redirected to produce medical countermeasures at the beginning of a pandemic... Streamlining manufacturing and regulatory approval processes that platform technologies might enable could allow us to **develop, manufacture, test, and distribute medical countermeasures in months, not years**.

From CEPI 100 Days Mission:
> The 100 Days Mission is the goal of having vaccines ready for use with initial emergency authorization within 100 days from the identification of a novel pathogen with pandemic potential.
>
> Creating the vaccine library could mean developing as many as 100 prototype vaccines to ensure coverage against almost any threat. Yes, that's a lot, but it's finite. It's also eminently achievable if governments and industry work together.

## Target timeline
