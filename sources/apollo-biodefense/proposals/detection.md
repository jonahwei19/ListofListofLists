## Quoted passages

From Executive Summary:
> The Apollo Program for Biodefense would provide the United States the opportunity to mobilize the nation and lead the world to meet these challenges: a world where we detect and continually trace any new pathogen from the source

From Technology Priority #5 (Ubiquitous Sequencing):
> **Metagenomic sequencing**, the reading of all genetic material from a sample, offers advantages that many other capabilities struggle to rival. All pathogens have genetic material and produce tell-tale signs in an infected individual, known as host-responses. Sequencing allows us to read these signals, and is crucial for early detection, characterization of pathogens, epidemiological tracking, attribution, and development of other biotechnologies generally. Crucially, sequencing offers the ability to detect pathogens without looking for a specific threat, which is essential to identifying novel pathogens, whether natural or engineered.

From Technology Priority #11 (National Pathogen Surveillance and Forecasting Center):
> An integrated real-time national pathogen surveillance and forecasting center with advanced capabilities to detect and model naturally occurring, accidentally released, and intentionally introduced biological threats does not currently exist. The abilities to identify and forecast threats rapidly is critical at the beginning of an outbreak and the understanding of infectious disease prevalence, including seasonal pathogens, are essential components of public health planning and response.
