## Quoted passages

From Executive Summary:
> The Apollo Program for Biodefense would provide the United States the opportunity to mobilize the nation and lead the world to meet these challenges: a world where... effective treatments are already in-hand

From Technology Priority #2 (Multi-Pathogen Therapeutic Drugs):
> At the very beginning of an outbreak of a novel pathogen, our best pharmaceutical line of defense will be those drugs that have either already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or those that have advanced far into clinical trials and can be rapidly deployed.
>
> To ensure that we have a multitude of drugs ready at the beginning of the next pandemic, we need to make investments in the development of **multi-pathogen therapeutics—those that can be effective against multiple phylogenies of viruses**. Previous efforts to develop multi-pathogen therapeutics have largely targeted direct-acting small molecule antivirals. However, new modalities are emerging that may result in increased breadth and potency and which warrant extra investment, including host-directed antivirals and monoclonal antibodies targeting regions conserved across multiple viral species.
>
> Funding the development of a diverse repertoire of multi-pathogen therapeutics through Phase 1 clinical trials—and, for endemic pathogens that currently affect populations throughout the world, Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials—would ensure that we could treat patients as early as possible in an outbreak, no matter the pathogen.
