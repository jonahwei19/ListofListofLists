## Quoted passages

From Executive Summary:
> The Apollo Program for Biodefense would provide the United States the opportunity to mobilize the nation and lead the world to meet these challenges: a world where... we can distribute rapid point-of-person tests to every household in the country within days of that detection

From Technology Priority #8 (Point-of-Person Diagnostics):
> Rapid point-of-person diagnostics, also known as point-of-need diagnostics, are tests that can rapidly identify an infection wherever the individual is located. Point-of-person diagnostics stand in contrast to clinically administered diagnostics, which often require transportation to centralized laboratories, and days or weeks before rendering results.
>
> **Rapid testing can enable detection. Tests that take more than three days to produce a result are essentially useless in the context of outbreak control since beyond that point contact tracing becomes increasingly difficult.**
>
> Point-of-person diagnostics should be considered public health instruments, as opposed to simply clinical tools. Rapid tests should be readily available, minimally-invasive, portable, and user-friendly (i.e., easy to conduct and interpret).

From Technology Priority #7 (Massively Multiplexed Detection):
> **Multiplexed detection capabilities** address these challenges and bring new benefits by simultaneously testing for multiple pathogens, resistance genes, biomarkers, and analytes in a single simple assay. Massively multiplexed detection capabilities in the form of pan-viral and pan-microbial assays have also been demonstrated, ushering in a new paradigm for diagnostics.

## Target timeline
Nationwide testing within 1 week of pathogen detection by 2030

## Investment scale
Part of ~$10B/year overall Apollo budget
