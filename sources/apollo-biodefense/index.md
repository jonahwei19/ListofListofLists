# Apollo Program for Biodefense

**Authors**: Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense (Lieberman, Ridge, Daschle, Greenwood, Wainstein, Monaco)
**Type**: Commission report
**Status**: Processed (4 capability goals extracted)

## Overview

Ambitious 2021 roadmap to "end the era of pandemic threats by 2030." Modeled on the Apollo space program. Investment scale: ~$10 billion annually. Follow-up report "The Athena Agenda" (2022) provides implementation details.

## Four Capability Goals

| Goal | Target | Kill Chain Step | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Detection** | Detect and trace any new pathogen from source | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Metagenomic sequencing, wastewater surveillance, sentinel systems. Maps to existing early detection interventions. |
| **Testing** | Rapid point-of-person tests nationwide within days of detection | [[terrorism/extinction]] | At-home diagnostics, decentralized testing infrastructure. Faster than current outbreak response. |
| **Treatment** | Effective treatments available for any pathogen | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Broad-spectrum antivirals, platform therapeutics. Defense against novel agents. |
| **Vaccines** | Develop and distribute vaccines in weeks, not years | [[terrorism/extinction]] | mRNA platforms, 100-day vaccine goal. Manufacturing surge capacity. |

## Key Insight

All four goals target the **extinction** step—detecting and responding to attacks after they occur. No explicit focus on:
- **Proliferation** prevention (stopping dangerous capability from reaching bad actors)
- **Creation** prevention (stopping AI from providing bio uplift)

This is traditional biosecurity framing, not AI-enabled bio threat framing. Defense-focused, not offense-prevention-focused.

## What's Novel

- **100-day vaccine timeline**: Specific, aggressive target for vaccine development. More concrete than most proposals.
- **"End pandemics by 2030"**: Framing as achievable national goal, not perpetual risk management.
- **Investment scale**: $10B/year baseline—provides benchmark for what serious pandemic preparedness costs.

## Gaps to Note

- Traditional biosecurity focus—no AI-bio intersection
- Government-centric implementation (less relevant for philanthropic/private funding)
- Detailed technology recommendations in PDF require manual extraction
