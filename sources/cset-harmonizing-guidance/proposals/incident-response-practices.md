## Relevant CSET Practices (Incident Response Topic)

### IR-1: Preparation
> "Create incident response and recovery plans. Identify stakeholders who will need to receive incident information. Designate responsibility for the execution of those plans. Conduct exercises to practice planned actions and assess their effectiveness."

**AI Score**: 31%

### IR-2: Governance
> "Assign roles and responsibilities for incident response, including backups. Ensure the team is competently trained and has the requisite decision-making authority for response. Establish clear communication channels. Provide sufficient resourcing for response activities."

**AI Score**: 38%

### IR-3: Detection and Identification
> "Define incident criteria and severity levels. Establish protected and confidential reporting mechanisms. Triage events and reported incidents. Initiate response actions when incident criteria has been met."

**AI Score**: 43%

### IR-6: Reporting
> "Report incident information to relevant authorities and stakeholders including affected communities, collaborative incident tracking initiatives, and information-sharing organizations."

**AI Score**: 59%

### IR-9: Lessons Learned
> "Collect and share lessons learned from incidents when they occur. Implement improvements to safety measures, security controls, and response plans based on post-hoc analysis and reviews."

**AI Score**: 26%

## Identified Gap: AI Incident Reporting

The CSET report explicitly identifies incident reporting as a gap in existing AI guidance:

> "Incident reporting: Transparency and communication related to AI incidents has been a central topic of discussion among policymakers and the AI safety community. Incident reporting mechanisms exist in many industries. Some of these forums are voluntary, while others are legally required depending on sector, jurisdiction, and type of incident (e.g., safety, cybersecurity, privacy). However, reporting requirements can become murky when incidents involve AI. Some AI-related incidents plainly fall under the umbrella of a cybersecurity incident, safety violation, or privacy breach and should be handled as such. Others cases are not so clear. While organizations should leverage existing structures and internal incident management teams, these structures may need to be updated or expanded to account for AI-related incidents. Further guidance on how to best capture AI incidents through available reporting mechanisms and how to handle AI incidents that may not neatly fall into existing buckets would be valuable to organizations."

## Connection to Existing Interventions

**AI Incident Reporting Framework**: The CSET report directly validates this intervention by identifying it as a gap. IR-3's "protected and confidential reporting mechanisms" and IR-6's "collaborative incident tracking initiatives" align with the aviation-style reporting model.

**Cross-Org Incident Detection**: IR-6's emphasis on "information-sharing organizations" and IR-9's "collect and share lessons learned" support cross-organizational coordination.

**Cross-Border AI Incident Notification**: IR-6 includes reporting to "relevant authorities" which extends to international coordination.

## Low AI Scores Indicate Gap

The relatively low AI Scores for incident response practices (26-59%) confirm that this area has received less attention in AI-specific guidance compared to broader cybersecurity frameworks. This validates the need for AI-specific incident reporting infrastructure.
