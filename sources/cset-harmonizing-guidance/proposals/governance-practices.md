## Connection to Existing Interventions

**Intergovernmental Frontier Model Forum**: SL-4's "coordinate and align these activities with each other and with those of external partners" and AU-6's "encourage collaboration and communication between teams, both internally and externally" support international coordination.

**Government AI Expertise Centers**: RM-4 and RM-5's risk identification and assessment practices require expertise. The report notes organizations need "time, resources, and expertise that many organizations, particularly smaller ones, cannot afford."

**Government Risk Framework Expansion**: SL-1's call for "organization-wide strategy for managing technology" and SL-4's "integrated risk management" directly support government adoption of AI risk frameworks.

**AI Policy Studio**: AU-7's "share policies, practices, and outcomes related to these initiatives publicly" and RM-10's communication requirements support policy development infrastructure.

## Key Quote on Framework Value

From the Executive Summary:
> "To address these challenges, the researchers at CSET have attempted to do this intensive work for organizations. In this report, we present a harmonized framework for how an organization should govern, manage, and protect its technology—and how to integrate emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence into its existing practices."

The report itself validates the need for accessible guidance: "Organizations face an overload of information, coming from a myriad of disparate sources, that is often written in language that can be inaccessible to many organizations."
