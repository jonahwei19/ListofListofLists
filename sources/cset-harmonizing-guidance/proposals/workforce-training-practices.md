## Relevant CSET Practices (Workforce & Training Topic)

### WF-1: Training and Awareness
> "Work with personnel to develop their risk management, privacy, and cybersecurity skills. Provide general awareness and role-specific training. Conduct regular competency and knowledge checks to ensure ongoing compliance."

**AI Score**: 30%

### WF-2: Roles and Responsibilities
> "Establish clear internal governance structures with delineated roles and responsibilities for risk management, monitoring and response, safety, security, and privacy functions."

**AI Score**: 51%

### WF-3: Resource Allocation
> "Provide personnel and human resources with adequate resources to implement and carry out organizational processes, policies, and controls."

**AI Score**: 19%

### WF-4: Policy and Enforcement
> "Establish, communicate, and enforce organizational policies. Ensure that personnel understand their responsibilities in upholding these policies and hold individuals accountable for doing so."

**AI Score**: 35%

### WF-5: Culture
> "Foster a positive safety, cybersecurity, privacy, and risk-aware culture. Demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity, collaboration, and ethical values. Hire and retain competent personnel who will help further these goals."

**AI Score**: 43%

## Identified Gap: AI Workforce Guidance

The CSET report explicitly identifies workforce as a gap in existing AI guidance:

> "Workforce: While existing guidance discusses the societal impacts that AI will have on the workforce, there are little to no recommendations related to how organizations should be addressing that impact internally. Organizations need to be thinking about how worker displacement may affect their own employees and develop strategies to manage these changes, such as through re-skilling initiatives. Furthermore, there is a lack of guidance on how to upskill an organization's existing workforce to competently use and manage AI tools. There is a similar gap related to awareness training for employees that covers synthetic content and related risks, responsible use of AI tools, and general AI literacy."

## Connection to Existing Interventions

**AI Evaluator Training**: WF-1's "role-specific training" and "regular competency and knowledge checks" apply to building evaluation expertise. The low AI Scores (19-51%) confirm this area needs AI-specific development.

**AI Security Expert Training**: WF-1's skills development and WF-5's "hire and retain competent personnel" support specialized security training programs.

**Regulatory Talent Placement**: WF-2's governance structures and WF-3's resource allocation apply to government agencies needing AI expertise. The report notes that "time, resources, and expertise that many organizations, particularly smaller ones, cannot afford" is a key barrier.

## Broader Context

The report notes that the Workforce & Training cluster had only 239 recommendations from 22 reports, and only 27% of those came from AI-specific guidance. This confirms the gap in AI workforce preparation practices.

From the methodology context:
> "Organizations seeking to take a comprehensive approach to AI—addressing issues related to safety, security, risk management, privacy, and due diligence just to name a few—must gather relevant information from a variety of sources, both AI-specific and more general."

The expertise bottleneck affects both private organizations and government regulators.
