**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Replicate human brain function in computational systems. While not considered as urgent as other alignment approaches, it was argued that some attempts at Whole Brain Emulation research technology should be pursued as a potential pathway to better understanding intelligence. This approach could provide insights into consciousness and potentially offer alternative routes to developing safe advanced AI. The work would likely require substantial interdisciplinary collaboration between neuroscientists, computer scientists, and philosophers.

## Why it matters
Brain emulation could provide insights into intelligence that inform alignment, or offer an alternative development path with different safety properties than current AI architectures.
