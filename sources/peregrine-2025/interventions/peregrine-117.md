# International Risk Management

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #117
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Strengthen recent international initiatives like the UN Pact for the Future and the US Global Catastrophic Risk Management Act with sustained financial and political support. These initiatives represent nascent frameworks for coordinated AI risk management across borders, which need to move beyond conceptual frameworks towards operational protocols with implementation capabilities. Building on these foundations would enable coordinated global responses to AI-related risks rather than fragmented national approaches.

## Why it matters
International frameworks for AI risk management exist on paper but lack the resources and political backing to be effective. Without sustained support, these initiatives will remain aspirational rather than operational.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: UN (Pact for the Future), US Government (Global Catastrophic Risk Management Act)
