# Anti-Poisoning Techniques

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #165
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Prevent the intentional corruption of AI training data or inputs. Protection mechanisms would include advanced detection systems for identifying suspicious data patterns, resilient training methodologies that maintain performance even when portions of data are compromised, and recovery protocols for systems that may have been exposed to poisoned inputs. Research in this area requires careful coordination across different security teams currently working in isolation on similar problems.

## Why it matters
Data poisoning attacks could subtly compromise model behavior in ways that evade standard testing, creating backdoors or biased outputs that only manifest in specific contexts. Robust anti-poisoning measures protect the integrity of the entire training pipeline.

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (multiple security teams working in isolation)
