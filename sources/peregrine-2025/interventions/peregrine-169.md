# AI for Formally Verified Cyberdefense

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #169
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Rewrite software to be secure by default using formal verification methods. This initiative would involve recruiting cybersecurity experts from leading organizations like Google and NSA, aimed at hardening critical national infrastructure against attacks and creating AI-powered active defense systems. Examples of protections include early warning systems for unusual exploitation patterns, hardened systems resistant to automated attacks, and resilient backup capabilities that maintain function during sophisticated intrusions.

## Why it matters
Critical infrastructure is built on decades-old code with unknown vulnerabilities. AI-assisted rewriting with formal verification could systematically harden these systems before AI-powered attacks can exploit them at scale.
