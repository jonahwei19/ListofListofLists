# Compute Governance

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #91
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Implement governance systems for global AI computation resources by creating technical and policy frameworks to track and potentially regulate high-capability computing. This involves development of monitoring systems for major compute clusters, transparency requirements for large-scale training runs, and verification mechanisms for compute usage claims.

## Why it matters
Provides greater visibility into who controls computational resources, what systems are being developed, and potential capability thresholds being approached. Requires substantial government involvement for effectiveness.
