# Accountability Frameworks

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #97
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Develop robust accountability and traceability governance approaches as well as liability systems for labs. As a reference, aerospace safety significantly improved when airlines faced meaningful liability, suggesting similar mechanisms could incentivize responsible AI development.

## Why it matters
Without liability, labs have insufficient incentives to invest in safety. Aerospace demonstrates that accountability drives safety improvements.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (noted that getting international players like China to participate could prove challenging)
