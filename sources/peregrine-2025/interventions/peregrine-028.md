# Synthesis, Consensus, and Paying Down Research Debt

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #28
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop better information-sharing mechanisms for topics like mechanistic interpretability, where different experts hold dramatically different assessments. The work would involve publishing analyses that clarify current cruxes in technical debates, generating evidence to address these cruxes rather than allowing uncertainty to persist indefinitely. Current discussions remain fragmented with little consensus-building or evidence generation to resolve key disagreements.

## Why it matters
The AI safety field has accumulated significant research debt: key disagreements persist without resolution, experts can't evaluate each other's claims, and resources are wasted on parallel efforts. Systematic synthesis work would accelerate progress by identifying which uncertainties actually matter, resolving disagreements with evidence, and creating shared understanding across research groups.
