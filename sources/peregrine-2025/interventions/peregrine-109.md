# Increased ARIA Support

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #109
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Increase support for the UK's AI efforts, with a particular focus on ARIA's (Advanced Research and Invention Agency) efforts in hardware mechanisms and non-LLM based agent development approaches. The UK is pioneering numerous reasonable approaches to AI safety including engagement with China and technical verification methods. These initiatives represent sensible alternatives to accelerating the LLM paradigm while still capturing economic benefits, and expanding these efforts would demonstrate viable paths for beneficial AI development without unnecessarily increasing risk.

## Why it matters
Alternative AI development paths that are safer than the current LLM paradigm exist but are underfunded. Supporting ARIA's work on hardware mechanisms and non-LLM approaches could demonstrate that safety and capability are not mutually exclusive.

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Who's working on it**: ARIA (UK Advanced Research and Invention Agency)
