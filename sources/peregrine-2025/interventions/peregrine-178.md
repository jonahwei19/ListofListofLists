# Public Demonstration Projects (Usefulness)

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #178
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create demos and launching campaigns about the positive capabilities of frontier AI systems to decision-makers who currently underestimate their power and potential. Many influential people remain unwilling to invest even modest sums to access closed models and consequently fail to understand the current state of the technology. Create compelling demonstrations of beneficial applications alongside risk assessments to educate key stakeholders about opportunities and challenges.

## Why it matters
Decision-makers who underestimate AI capabilities won't take governance seriously. Demonstrating both the power and the risks creates the urgency needed for meaningful policy action.
