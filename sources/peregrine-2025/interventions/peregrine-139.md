# Biosecurity Controls

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #139
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement strong controls over sensitive data that could enable harmful applications, particularly for biological and other dual-use technologies. This would include developing methods to "train out this data, exclude it, grep it against the data source," alongside implementing more robust "KYC (Know Your Customer) guidelines all around the stack." The aim would be to develop specific detection mechanisms for biology-related queries, create safety measures for capabilities relevant to biological design, and establish evaluation protocols for potentially dangerous information. Full-specification models would only be available to licensed institutions to prevent proliferation of dangerous capabilities.

## Why it matters
AI models trained on biological data could provide detailed instructions for creating dangerous pathogens. Controlling access to this data and implementing screening for dangerous queries could significantly reduce biosecurity risks from AI.
