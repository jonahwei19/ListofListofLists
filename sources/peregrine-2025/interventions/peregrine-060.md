## What it is
Found human-based verification and auditing bodies specifically for AI, similar to the IAEA's role in nuclear oversight. This requires bringing together experts from nuclear verification, cybersecurity, and AI technical domains to design protocols and organizational structures capable of credibly verifying compliance with safety standards. The institution would need sufficient technical capacity, international legitimacy, and access rights to effectively monitor development at leading labs while respecting intellectual property and national security concerns.

## Why it matters
No organization is currently designing such institutions despite their critical importance for any international governance framework. Without institutional infrastructure, governance remains theoretical.
