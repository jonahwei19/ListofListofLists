# Attack Scenarios Analysis

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #155
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop and publish detailed, evidence-based analyses of plausible catastrophic scenarios, rather than allowing discourse to veer into unlikely extremes like preemptive nuclear strikes. Current strategic discussions often lack grounding in basic analysis, with public narratives frequently devolving into unproductive memes disconnected from reality. This initiative would conduct professional wargaming exercises that bring together key stakeholders to explore scenarios methodically, creating shared understanding among the core 500-1,000 people who need this knowledge.

## Why it matters
Without rigorous scenario analysis, public and policy discourse defaults to either dismissal or sci-fi extremes. Grounded threat models enable proportionate responses and help key decision-makers coordinate around realistic risks.
