# Policy Studio/Competition

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #108
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create a dedicated policy innovation hub which would draft specific legislation, regulations, and governance frameworks for AI safety, alongside writing clear explainers of the legislation and what it is trying to accomplish, addressing the issue of existing policy proposals being "too nebulous". The studio would identify potential implementation pitfalls in future legislation by examining past regulatory failures like SB 1047, while developing concrete policy solutions.

## Why it matters
Current AI policy proposals are often too vague to be actionable, and policy failures like SB 1047 suggest the need for more careful policy design. A dedicated policy studio could produce higher-quality, more implementable governance frameworks.
