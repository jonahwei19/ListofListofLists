# Meta-Research on Safety Techniques

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #47
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Conduct research that evaluates and validates the effectiveness of different AI safety approaches. This research program would require multiple independent actors to assess the same models using different techniques, in order to compare results to determine reliability and blind spots. This proposal was mentioned as necessary for AI alignment to move beyond piecemeal theoretical approaches, and towards empirical safety science with repeatable, testable methodologies that can scale with increasing capabilities.

## Why it matters
We don't actually know which safety techniques work. Different groups use different methods and report different results with no systematic comparison. Meta-research that rigorously evaluates safety approaches would identify which techniques are actually effective, rather than just theoretically promising.
