# Monitor Complex Agent Interactions

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #78
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop systems to monitor dynamics between multiple AI agents interacting in complex environments. This field remains underdeveloped, and agentic interactions are either poorly captured or not well-conceptualized within existing frameworks. Teams would create implementations that actively watch deployments and interactions between systems, identifying potentially harmful feedback loops or emergent goals before they become problematic.

## Why it matters
As AI systems increasingly interact with each other, emergent behaviors could arise that weren't present in individual systems. Without monitoring, these dynamics remain invisible until they cause harm.
