# On-Chip Monitoring Mechanisms

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #70
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop hardware-level monitoring technologies embedded directly into chips to verify that countries aren't pursuing dangerous AI developments in violation of international agreements (e.g. AI intelligence explosions), similar to nuclear verification protocols. The organization would employ hardware engineers, designers, and manufacturing specialists to prototype verification technologies that could be integrated with commercial chip manufacturing.

## Why it matters
Provides the technical foundation for international treaty compliance and detection of illicit national-scale AI activity. Proves to governments that such verification is possible.

## Current state
