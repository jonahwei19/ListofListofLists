# Public Demonstration Projects (Future Risks)

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #179
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create personalized "Day After" scenarios that tangibly demonstrate AI risks in ways individuals can personally relate to, and amplifying existing demonstrations of AI capabilities and risks that currently reach limited audiences - for instance, scenarios where individuals' interests such as children's funds are threatened. Bottlenecks for existing organizations include a lack of resources and expertise to communicate their demonstrations broadly.

## Why it matters
Abstract risk narratives don't motivate action. Personalized scenarios that connect AI risks to things people care about (family, finances, security) create emotional engagement that drives policy support.

## Current state
