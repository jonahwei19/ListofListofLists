# Global Frameworks for AI Development

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #118
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish "Sherpa" networks, with designated representatives from different countries maintaining regular communication channels and coordinating policy responses. China and other countries appear to have similar levels of AI risk awareness, creating opportunities for meaningful international agreements. The initiative could build upon foundations established through efforts like the Bletchley Park Summit and Seoul AI summit, expanding participation and formalizing commitments.

## Why it matters
International AI coordination currently happens through ad-hoc summits rather than sustained working relationships. Establishing permanent "Sherpa" networks would enable ongoing coordination and faster response to emerging issues.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Building on Bletchley Park Summit and Seoul AI summit efforts
