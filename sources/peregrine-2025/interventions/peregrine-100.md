# Regulatory Talent

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #100

**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Place a thousand competent, mission-aligned experts in government positions globally, with the aim to improve the talent pool of people working AI governance. This would involve strategic talent allocation across critical agencies like the EU AI Office, various AIs (AI Centers), and other regulatory bodies. Focus on enhancing government capabilities from within, ensuring regulators have both the technical understanding and motivation to implement oversight mechanisms and policies.

## Why it matters
Government capacity to regulate AI is constrained by lack of technical expertise. Placing experts in regulatory positions directly addresses this bottleneck.
