## What it is
Build relationships between technical experts and policymakers by creating institutional bridges that translate AI safety research into actionable governance frameworks. This work would develop shared vocabularies, educational resources, and collaboration mechanisms to ensure policy development is technically informed while remaining practically implementable. Regular exchanges between technical teams and government officials would help anticipate regulatory needs, shape technical development toward governance-amenable directions, and ensure oversight mechanisms remain effective as AI capabilities advance.

## Why it matters
Policymakers often lack technical understanding of AI, while technical experts lack policy expertise. This disconnect leads to either ineffective regulation or no regulation at all. Bridging this gap is essential for governance that actually works.
