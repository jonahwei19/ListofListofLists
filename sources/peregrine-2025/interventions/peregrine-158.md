# Food Security

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #158
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Prepare for the disruption of global food networks and conventional agriculture becoming less available, such as by developing seaweed cultivation and making it accessible in areas with suitable climates but no relevant expertise such as Nigeria. Additional measures include specialized seedbanks and conversion of less vital industrial facilities such as paper mills to emergency food production through cellulose processing.

## Why it matters
AI-catalyzed catastrophes (nuclear war, infrastructure collapse, pandemics) could rapidly disrupt global food supply chains. Pre-positioned alternative food production capabilities and knowledge transfer prevent mass starvation scenarios.

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Who's working on it**: ALLFED (related work on alternative foods)
