# Intelligence Explosion Monitoring

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #84
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish metrics and monitoring systems to detect when AI systems begin contributing more to their own improvement than human researchers, tracking acceleration in capabilities against predefined thresholds that would trigger emergency protocols before reaching full AGI.

## Why it matters
Provides early warning when AI progress enters exponential growth phases, enabling intervention before rapid capability jumps make control more difficult or when labs might be incentivized to keep breakthroughs secret.
