# Democratic Support

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #114
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Support organizations focused on democratic accountability and institutional integrity, which provide essential infrastructure for addressing any technological threat including advanced AI systems. Democratic stability has become increasingly precarious worldwide, with democracy indices showing deterioration across multiple countries as legitimate democratic organizations face defunding or delegitimization campaigns. In Germany, initiatives like Effektiv Spenden have created specialized funds to recommend and support democracy-strengthening organizations that could serve as models for similar efforts globally. The most effective approach would target multiple countries simultaneously with coordinated support for local democratic institutions.

## Why it matters
Democratic institutions are the foundation for legitimate AI governance. If these institutions are weakened, the ability to establish and enforce AI safety regulations diminishes. AI could also accelerate democratic erosion through disinformation and manipulation.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Effektiv Spenden (Germany), various democracy-strengthening organizations
