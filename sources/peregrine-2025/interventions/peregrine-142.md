## What it is
Create organizations focused specifically on leveraging AI to strengthen societal defenses against misuse, particularly for biological weapons and cyber threats. Such attacks might be associated with state actors without clear attribution, creating complex response scenarios that require advanced preparation. This initiative would develop specific technological safeguards, monitoring systems, and response protocols for the most concerning misuse vectors, prioritizing those that could emerge within the next 12-24 months.

## Why it matters
AI capabilities for offense are developing faster than defenses. Dedicated organizations using AI for defensive purposes could help maintain the balance between attack and defense capabilities.
