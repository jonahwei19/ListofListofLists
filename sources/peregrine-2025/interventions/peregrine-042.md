# Interactive Inspection Tools

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #42
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Move beyond basic evaluation numbers and develop rich, interactive interfaces for users to explore model behaviors through natural language queries like "Why did the model fail on this task?" or "How would it perform if it had internet access?". Current AI evaluation methods reduce complex system behavior to simplistic benchmark scores that fail to capture important nuances. Instead of static reports, these tools would provide dynamic dashboards where users can probe model capabilities, investigate failures, and perform detailed sensitivity analyses. Such inspection tools would have to be AI-backed to scale with increasing model capabilities, using specialized AI systems to interpret and explain the behaviors of frontier models.

## Why it matters
Static benchmark scores hide critical information about when and how models fail. Interactive tools would let evaluators explore edge cases, understand failure modes, and discover risks that benchmarks miss. AI-backed inspection is necessary because human evaluators can't keep up with the volume and complexity of model behaviors.
