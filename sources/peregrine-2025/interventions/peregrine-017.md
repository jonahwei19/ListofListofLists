# Automated Science - Hunch Agents

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #17
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop AI systems capable of replicating the creative scientific thinking process of pioneers. These "hunch agents" would autonomously generate novel scientific hypotheses and alignment approaches, potentially accelerating progress by orders of magnitude beyond human-led research. The ideal is to present a working meta-level approach to alignment by attempting to automate the discovery process itself rather than pursuing specific technical solutions, creating a positive feedback loop where AI helps develop better alignment techniques for increasingly capable AI systems.

## Why it matters
Alignment research may need to progress faster than human researchers can work alone, especially if AI capabilities advance rapidly. Automating scientific discovery for alignment could provide the research acceleration needed to stay ahead of capability development, turning AI into a tool for its own safety.
