# Agent Trace Analysis

## What it is
Create tools that automatically analyze the logs of actions by autonomous systems. AI agents performing sequential autonomous actions produce complex interaction logs that are far too lengthy for human review, creating significant challenges for evaluation and oversight. Autonomous coding agents can generate thousands of lines of code and interaction steps containing critical security flaws that even expert teams might miss for months. Developing specialized tools to analyze these traces, highlight anomalous behavior patterns, and extract human-readable summaries would enable effective oversight of increasingly autonomous systems.

## Why it matters
As AI agents become more autonomous and perform longer sequences of actions, human oversight becomes physically impossible through direct review. Without automated analysis tools, dangerous behaviors or security flaws will go undetected until they cause harm. This is particularly critical for security-critical applications where catching problematic agent behavior before deployment is essential.
