# Strategic Coordination Frameworks

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #119
**Specificity**: Vague

## What it is
Develop coherent strategies where interventions strengthen each other, as opposed to being mere lists of possible interventions. The motivating ideal consists of integrated policy responses where components complement each other, avoiding fragmented efforts that lack synergy or pull in different directions (as is the case with interventions for centralizing AI development to mitigate race dynamics versus interventions for decentralizing AI development to mitigate power concentration).

## Why it matters
Current AI safety efforts are often uncoordinated and sometimes contradictory. Without strategic frameworks that identify how different interventions interact, resources may be wasted on efforts that cancel each other out.

## Current state
