# Comprehensive Incident Detection System

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #80
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create a standardized framework for logging, anonymizing, and analyzing AI misbehavior across organizations. Build infrastructure allowing developers and third-party researchers to search through incidents, identify patterns, and share findings while protecting sensitive user data and IP. Expand on systems like Anthropic's CLIO to enable rapid identification of concerning behaviors before they escalate into major incidents. Labs would collaborate directly with each other without a third party.

## Why it matters
Enables cross-organizational learning from incidents and rapid identification of concerning patterns. Without shared infrastructure, each lab discovers problems in isolation.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Anthropic (CLIO mentioned as existing system to expand upon)
