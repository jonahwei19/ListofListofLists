**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Fund crucial evaluation organizations in the AI security ecosystem such as SecureBio, PatternLabs, and Expo that handle cybersecurity and offensive evaluations. These companies represent a relatively small financial investment but perform critical functions in the evaluation landscape that could otherwise become bottlenecks.

## Why it matters
Without dedicated evaluation organizations, the ecosystem lacks the capacity to properly assess AI systems. These specialized functions require sustained funding to avoid becoming chokepoints.

## Current state
- **Status**: Deployed
- **Who's working on it**: SecureBio, PatternLabs, Expo
