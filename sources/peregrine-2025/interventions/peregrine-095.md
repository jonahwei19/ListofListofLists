# Training Data Licensing

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #95
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement a regulated market for high-quality, difficult-to-replicate training data. There is a potentially "huge market of hard-to-get data" which cannot yet be automated. This aims to fairly compensate those whose data is used for AI training while providing nations and regulatory bodies leverage over AI development. Companies needing specialized data like scientific papers or professional knowledge would need to comply with regulations to maintain access, creating "natural incentives for companies to sign up" to oversight mechanisms.

## Why it matters
Creates economic incentives for compliance with governance frameworks by controlling access to valuable training data.
