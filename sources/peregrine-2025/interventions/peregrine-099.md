# Expert Collaboration

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #99
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Assemble top economists and geopolitics experts to work intensively at a retreat to model AI governance challenges, with focus on preventing both monopolistic AI control and the chaotic diffusion of dangerous AI capabilities. Following the expert collaboration, direct significant funding toward implementing whatever solutions the economists and geopolitics experts identify as most promising.

## Why it matters
AI governance requires expertise beyond the AI safety community. Concentrated expert collaboration could produce actionable insights that diffuse discussion cannot.
