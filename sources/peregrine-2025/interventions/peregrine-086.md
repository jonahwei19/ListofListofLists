# "Golden Period" Identification Framework

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #86
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish metrics and monitoring systems to detect when AI capabilities reach the 10-100x productivity enhancement threshold without compromising security. Create coordination mechanisms to extend this period from weeks to months, allowing humanity to maximize benefits from relatively safe systems before advancing to potentially riskier models. Develop strategy frameworks for optimal exploitation of this window.

## Why it matters
There may be a limited window where AI provides substantial benefits with manageable risks. Without deliberate coordination, this window could be cut short by racing dynamics.
