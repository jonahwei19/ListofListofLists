# Public Audits

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #59
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Have independent organizations conduct comprehensive public audits of open-weight models with substantial compute resources. These audits would demonstrate in public what thorough model analysis should look like, creating a template for what information should be available about any deployed AI system. By performing audits in public settings, the process opens to community feedback and improvement, establishing consensus on best practices.

## Why it matters
Creates public precedents for robust evaluation that would be difficult for private labs to ignore, essentially raising the "floor" for responsible disclosure without requiring immediate regulation.
