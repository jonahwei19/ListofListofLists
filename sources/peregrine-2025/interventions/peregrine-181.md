# Build Intergovernmental Expertise

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #181
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish trusted expertise centers within government and international institutions to educate policymakers on AI implications. This provides authoritative briefings on emerging capabilities and sectoral impacts, creating informed decision-making capacity. The approach acknowledges that technical solutions alone are insufficient without parallel education efforts.

## Why it matters
Policymakers can't regulate what they don't understand. Embedded expertise centers provide ongoing education that keeps pace with rapidly evolving capabilities, enabling informed rather than reactive governance.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
