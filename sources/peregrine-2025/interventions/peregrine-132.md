**Specificity**: Vague

## What it is
Work to resolve major global conflicts (particularly those involving nuclear powers) before advanced AI development increases geopolitical tensions. Special consideration is given to nuclear powers, which might use their nuclear capability as negotiating leverage. This project would develop scenarios for how nuclear threats might manifest during AI negotiations and create strategies to prevent escalation.

## Why it matters
AI development occurs against a backdrop of existing geopolitical tensions. Unresolved conflicts could interact dangerously with AI race dynamics, particularly if nuclear powers perceive existential stakes in AI competition.
