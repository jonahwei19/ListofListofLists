# Defense-in-Depth Analysis of Post-training

**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Take an open model produced by an organization like DeepSeek and systematically implement every known safety technique on it, measuring how these approaches stack together and where they might conflict or have gaps. This engineering project would focus on which combinations provide comprehensive coverage, testing against real attacks rather than flawed safety benchmarks.

## Why it matters
Safety techniques are typically studied in isolation, but deployed systems need multiple layers of protection. Understanding how different safety measures interact, whether they complement or undermine each other, and which combinations provide the most robust protection is essential for building truly secure systems. Testing against real attacks reveals practical vulnerabilities that benchmarks miss.
