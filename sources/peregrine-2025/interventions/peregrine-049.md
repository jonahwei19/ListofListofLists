# Vulnerability Matching

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #49
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Directly connect discovered AI vulnerabilities to appropriate research proposals addressing them. This approach would ensure funding flows efficiently to researchers tackling actual, identified problems rather than theoretical concerns. The system would continuously update as new vulnerabilities are discovered through red teaming, creating a rapid feedback loop between threat identification and solution development that significantly accelerates safety progress.

## Why it matters
Currently, safety research funding decisions are disconnected from actual discovered vulnerabilities. Red teams find problems, but funding goes to proposals based on different criteria. A matching system would ensure resources go directly to solving identified problems, creating tight feedback between threat discovery and solution development.
