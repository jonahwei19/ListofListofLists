# Targeted Communications Campaign

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #184
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Identify the constituents who impact critical AI decisions and make them more aware of challenges in AI security, possibly recruiting marketing experts. The project should involve testing various messages to determine which resonate most effectively, and delivering these targeted messages through appropriate channels.

## Why it matters
Broad public campaigns are expensive and diffuse. Targeted messaging to specific constituencies (investors, board members, key legislators) can shift decisions at critical leverage points with far less resources.
