# CERN for AI

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #116
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create an international AI development consortium similar to CERN or Intelsat to allow unified research without competitive pressures. Once established, this model would defer complex technical safety decisions to the project itself rather than attempting to coordinate disparate corporate efforts. CERN-like infrastructure would enable experiments impossible elsewhere, particularly for safety research requiring extraordinary computational resources. The aim would be to construct a facility that could serve as a neutral, international testbed for evaluating advanced AI systems under controlled conditions, but doing so would require dramatically expanding the role of governments in technology decisions.

## Why it matters
Competitive dynamics between labs and nations accelerate AI development while undermining safety. An international consortium could remove these competitive pressures and enable collaborative safety research that no single lab could undertake alone.
