## What it is
Reframe security concerns away from attempts to constrain digital models, and instead toward physical world interfaces, with particular focus on limiting mass production of robotic systems. If control of AI systems ultimately comes down to physical constraints rather than digital ones, the most critical question concerns whether AI systems could acquire enough physical force in the world to enact harmful outcomes.

## Why it matters
If model proliferation is "inevitable and unstoppable," the most effective chokepoints may be at the level of physical implementation rather than digital model controls.
