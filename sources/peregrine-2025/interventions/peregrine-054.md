# Capability Assessment Framework

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #54
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop a systematic, grounded approach to evaluating which potential AI risks are most credible and which are overrated. This framework would distinguish between well-evidenced catastrophic harms and more speculative concerns, providing a realistic assessment of current capabilities and improvement trends.

## Why it matters
Helps influence and prioritize mitigation efforts by focusing resources on empirically validated risks rather than theoretical possibilities that may not materialize. Prevents both under- and over-reaction to AI capabilities.

## Current state
