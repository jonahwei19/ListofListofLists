# Legal Automation

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #206
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Automate legal functions with multiple applications including efforts to "protect your entities from people that will be weaponizing automated law." This capability would systematically identify and leverage legal mechanisms to both create appropriate friction for labs advancing too quickly and shield safety initiatives from legal challenges.

## Why it matters
Legal systems will increasingly be navigated by AI. Organizations without automated legal capabilities will be outmaneuvered by those with them. Safety-focused legal automation ensures that AI governance efforts aren't defeated by superior legal AI on the other side.
