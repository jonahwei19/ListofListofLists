# Cooperative Evals: AIs Working With Humans

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #46
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Undertake empirical research comparing human performance on various tasks, both with and without AI assistance (and with varying forms of AI systems). The aim would be to establish a better understanding of how humans might cause harm with AI models that wouldn't have been possible otherwise, in addition to providing information on how humans could be productively integrated with AI systems.

## Why it matters
The threat isn't just what AI can do alone, but what humans can do with AI assistance. A model might not be able to synthesize a pathogen, but it might enable a human to do so who couldn't before. Understanding the "uplift" AI provides to human capabilities is essential for assessing real-world risk.
