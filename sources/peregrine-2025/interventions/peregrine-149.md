## What it is
Plan for AI-driven economic transformation. This requires developing both technical systems and policy frameworks to maintain stability as automation potentially displaces human labor at unprecedented scale. This work should address how economic value and ownership will be distributed when AI systems drive productivity, considering issues like universal basic income, stake-based ownership models, and rethinking of work itself. The challenge is particularly complex because traditional economic models don't adequately account for a scenario where automation replaces labor rather than simply augmenting capital. This work focuses on longer term (still urgent because of its effect on imminent decisions) structural redesign of economic systems for a post-labor world.

## Why it matters
AI could displace human labor at a scale and speed unprecedented in economic history. Without advance planning for economic transition, the result could be mass unemployment, inequality, and social instability.
