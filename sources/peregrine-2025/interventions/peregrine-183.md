# Political Campaign Opposing Anti-Regulation Efforts

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #183
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Launch a large-scale political campaign led by PR/communications experts to oppose anti-regulation efforts, in order to shape public opinion on AI risks and build political will for governance. This would involve significant media engagement similar to political campaigns, with the aim of creating a public consensus that AI safety requires immediate action rather than becoming a partisan issue. Ideally the initiative would be able to survive shifting political environments.

## Why it matters
Well-funded anti-regulation campaigns can capture public narrative and make safety measures politically toxic. A counter-campaign ensures the safety perspective has comparable reach and can prevent AI governance from becoming a partisan wedge issue.
