# Researcher Buy-Out

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #37
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Buying out researchers with grants to redirect top AI talent from frontier capabilities work toward security research (estimated costs of $2-5 million per researcher). This investment would be conducted with the goal of significantly shifting the distribution of elite technical talent during the critical two-year window between 2025 and 2027.

## Why it matters
The best researchers are working on capabilities because that's where the money and prestige are. Safety research is talent-constrained. Directly paying researchers to switch fields could shift the capabilities-safety balance by redirecting elite talent to safety work during the critical period when alignment needs to be solved.
