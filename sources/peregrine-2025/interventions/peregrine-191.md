# Neuroscience Moonshots for Human-Compatible AGI

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #191
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Revisit early 2010s considerations of biophysically realistic simulations as AGI contenders before large neural networks emerged. This work would aim to scale and leverage existing institutions building automated systems for processing and extracting brain connectomes. Research could examine whether superior AGI architectures might be more mammalian in nature, building on a new neuro-AI safety white paper by leading neuroscientists. This research program would aim to impact international conversations around post-AGI development paths.

## Why it matters
Current transformer architectures may have intrinsic alignment problems. Brain-based architectures could offer alternative paths to AGI with different (potentially more favorable) safety properties, but require sustained investment to explore.

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Who's working on it**: Leading neuroscientists (white paper mentioned)
