# Game Theoretic AI Conflict Analysis

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #193
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Incubate a team of theorists comparable to the RAND Corporation's Cold War strategists to develop comprehensive understanding of AI conflict dynamics. This group would analyze the game theory of interactions between increasingly capable AI systems, and determine strategic approaches for maintaining stability and safety. The project would create theoretical frameworks for understanding and managing AI capabilities in competitive contexts, identifying potential cooperation mechanisms before dangerous capability races emerge.

## Why it matters
Cold War stability required game-theoretic analysis of nuclear dynamics. AI development creates analogous strategic complexity. Without rigorous theoretical frameworks, decision-makers will navigate by intuition in high-stakes situations.
