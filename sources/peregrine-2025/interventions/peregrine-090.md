# Human Verification Systems

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #90
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Build robust systems for verifying human identity to protect critical decision-making. Such systems become increasingly important as AI capabilities advance, helping distinguish human actors from AI systems, forming a critical component of security infrastructure in domains requiring human authorization. These systems would need continuous updates to counter increasingly sophisticated impersonation capabilities.

## Why it matters
As AI impersonation becomes more sophisticated, distinguishing humans from AI in high-stakes decisions becomes critical for maintaining human control and preventing AI systems from acquiring unauthorized access.
