# Development-Phase Accountability Tools

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #96
**Specificity**: Vague

## What it is
Create mechanisms to hold AI companies accountable during the critical model development period when many risks emerge. Current regulatory approaches focus heavily on deployment while neglecting development phases. This was claimed to represent significant "white space" in the oversight ecosystem.

## Why it matters
The internal, sensitive, and legally complex nature of development processes creates a gap where risks emerge but oversight is absent. Many problems are baked in before deployment.

## Current state
