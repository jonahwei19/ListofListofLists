# AI-Enhanced Defense Mechanisms

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #162
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Leveraging AI systems themselves as part of defensive infrastructure represents a necessity for scaling protective capabilities alongside offensive capabilities. This area has significant market potential but requires alignment-focused funders who won't derail development with premature commercialization pressures targeting conventional markets.

## Why it matters
Human-only defenses cannot scale to match AI-enhanced attacks. Using AI for defense creates an arms race dynamic where defensive capabilities can keep pace with offensive ones, maintaining a favorable security balance.
