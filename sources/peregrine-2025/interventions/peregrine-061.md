# Secure Frontier Data Centers

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #61
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Build SL4 strength data centers with scalability for increased energy requirements, creating frontier compute facilities that meet SCIF-level security standards (Secure Compartmentalized Information Facilities). Critical technologies like confidential computing and HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) need better innovation and activation. These facilities would provide infrastructure for secure AI development with proper containment protocols.

## Why it matters
Lab automation feedback loops become particularly dangerous in coming years. These facilities would prevent potential "data center uprisings" and catastrophic leaks by providing properly hardened infrastructure.
