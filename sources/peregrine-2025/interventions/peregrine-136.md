# UV Technology

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #136
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop Far-UVC light technology, which offers promising capabilities for continuous environmental sanitization without the risks associated with conventional UV systems. Safety testing should proceed rapidly while simultaneously building production capacity and stockpiles for deployment during serious outbreaks. Regulatory hurdles may be significant but could be navigated through specific use-case authorizations or emergency provisions. Production scaling should focus on both cost reduction and reliability improvement to enable widespread deployment.

## Why it matters
Far-UVC can continuously sterilize air and surfaces in occupied spaces without harming humans. This provides a technological defense against airborne pathogens, including those that might be engineered with AI assistance.
