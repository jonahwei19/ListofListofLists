# Western Multipolar AGI

**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Support non-US Western AGI projects (such as in the UK) as a counterbalance to US dominance in AI capabilities. This would create alternatives to US-based systems, potentially preventing problematic concentration of power and decision-making. The geopolitical implications of having multiple Western powers with AGI capabilities could create more balanced governance structures. This represents a strategic approach to addressing the international dimensions of AI development and risk management.

## Why it matters
Concentration of AGI development in a single country creates risks of power concentration and single points of failure. Multiple Western AGI projects could provide alternatives and mutual oversight while maintaining alignment with democratic values.
