# System-Level AI Effects

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #85
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Research beyond individual model safety into system-level effects from multiple AI models interacting in complex ecosystems. Current safety approaches primarily focus on organization-level defenses rather than addressing emergent behaviors that might arise from complex AI interactions in the wild. The field requires significantly more theoretical work on complex systems and practical exploration of multi-agent dynamics to identify and mitigate emergent risks.

## Why it matters
"Flash crash" type phenomena could emerge where distributed AI systems with poorly understood dynamics create cascading failures. Individual model safety is insufficient if system-level interactions create new risks.
