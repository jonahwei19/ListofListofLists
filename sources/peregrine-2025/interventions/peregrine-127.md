# Specialized Diplomatic Corps

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #127
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create specialized diplomatic corps focused specifically on AI governance with multilingual capacity and deep technical understanding of frontier capabilities, particularly for engagement with China. These specialized communicators could operate as third parties rather than from within governments or labs that may be too constrained to engage effectively. The focus would be on building bandwidth for substantive communication at the nation-state level, potentially with support from organizations like the Gates Foundation if they can develop strategy quickly enough.

## Why it matters
Effective AI diplomacy requires both technical expertise and diplomatic skills, a rare combination. Without specialized diplomatic capacity, AI governance discussions may be conducted by people who lack either the technical understanding or diplomatic experience needed.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Gates Foundation mentioned as potential supporter
