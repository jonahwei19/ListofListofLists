# Constitutional AI

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #14
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Use existing AI systems to evaluate and supervise future AI systems to ensure security and harmlessness. Human input is given through a set of rules - a Constitution - which an AI assistant uses to give feedback to a more advanced system in training.

## Why it matters
Human feedback doesn't scale: we can't label billions of examples or evaluate superhuman outputs. Constitutional AI provides a way to scale oversight by having AI systems evaluate other AI systems according to human-specified principles. This could enable supervision of systems whose outputs humans can't directly evaluate.

## Current state
- **Status**: Deployed
