# Consolidation of AI Development

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #130

**Specificity**: Vague

## What it is
Reduce the number of organizations building frontier AI systems to enable better governance, oversight and more effective implementation of safety measures and alignment techniques. Such consolidation could resemble an "AGI Manhattan Project" where the frontier technology is controlled by a single entity that can implement unified safety protocols. This approach would enable coordinated pausing of research based on safety considerations.

## Why it matters
Multiple competing frontier labs create race dynamics that undermine safety. Consolidating development into fewer (or one) entity could eliminate competitive pressure and enable more cautious, coordinated development.
