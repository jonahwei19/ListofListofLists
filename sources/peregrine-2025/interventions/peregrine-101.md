# Government AI Use

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #101
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Support governments in effectively using AI by developing specialized systems for policy implementation, monitoring, and regulatory oversight. This would be particularly critical in potential loss-of-control scenarios, where rapid technological change outpaces traditional governance mechanisms. These systems would help speed up government feedback loops, enabling more responsive regulation of AI-driven economic activity, while creating accountability and transparency mechanisms for government AI use that maintain democratic control while leveraging efficiency benefits.

## Why it matters
Governments risk being outpaced by AI development if they cannot effectively incorporate AI into their own operations. Without AI-assisted regulatory and monitoring tools, democratic institutions may be unable to respond quickly enough to emerging AI risks or maintain meaningful oversight of rapidly evolving technology.
