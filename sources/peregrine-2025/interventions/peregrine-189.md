# Whistleblower Protection Fund

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #189
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establishing a large, long-lived fund on the order of several hundred million dollars - enough to secure the livelihoods of a substantial cohort of potential whistleblowers for a decade and to cover major legal exposure. This would primarily protect employees of AI labs, but could also apply to government officials who refuse to follow orders they believe would endanger public safety related to AI development.

## Why it matters
Insiders with knowledge of dangerous practices face career destruction and legal liability if they speak out. A credible protection fund removes this barrier, enabling information flow that could prevent catastrophic decisions.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: AIWI (AI whistleblower initiatives mentioned)
