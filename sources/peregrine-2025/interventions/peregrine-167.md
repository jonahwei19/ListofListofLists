# Comprehensive Infosec Framework

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #167
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create a multi-layered security approach addressing the full spectrum of threat vectors: external human attackers, internal human threats, external model attackers, and internal model threats. This framework recognizes that securing model weights against theft is necessary but insufficient - the entire operational environment requires protection. The approach overlaps with traditional insider threat security but differs in that AI actions can be surveilled more intensively than human actions, allowing for specialized security measures tailored to AI systems.

## Why it matters
Current security frameworks don't account for AI-specific threat vectors like models attacking from inside or coordinating with external systems. A comprehensive framework that addresses all four quadrants (internal/external x human/AI) closes critical gaps.
