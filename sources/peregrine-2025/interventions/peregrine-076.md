# AI Forecasters

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #76
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop AI systems as superforecasters, employing forecasting feedback loops with real-world validation. These techniques could be incorporated into frontier models, allowing users to understand prediction logic and prevent avoidable errors. The systems would display large reasoning trees allowing users to inspect, understand, and modify the logic behind predictions, providing transparency beyond simple numerical probabilities.

## Why it matters
Becomes the default for people looking to find trustworthy predictions, improving decision-making across domains by making forecasting more reliable and transparent.
