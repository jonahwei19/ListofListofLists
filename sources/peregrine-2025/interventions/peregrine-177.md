# Lobbying Support Tools

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #177
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create resources that enhance the effectiveness of existing lobbying organizations rather than competing with them. Instead of lobbyists conducting demonstrations individually, the project would develop more standardized video content and presentation materials that showcase AI capabilities and risks. This approach would allow lobbyists to reach thousands rather than conducting one-on-one demonstrations, significantly amplifying their reach and impact while providing them with professionally created supporting materials that clearly communicate complex concepts.

## Why it matters
Lobbyists are constrained by time and lack of compelling visual materials. High-quality, standardized demonstration content multiplies the reach of existing advocacy efforts without building redundant organizations.
