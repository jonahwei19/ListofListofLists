## What it is
Coordinate a large-scale effort to develop concrete plans for what society would look like after the development of artificial general intelligence. It would likely need governmental backing to establish agreed-upon frameworks for managing the transition to a world with superintelligent systems. The work should include consideration of "extreme plans" and honest assessments of what might be required in various scenarios. This planning must address both upside and downside cases, including minimum demands humanity would have even in scenarios where AI systems pursue their own goals.

## Why it matters
Without pre-established frameworks, the transition to AGI could be chaotic, with ad-hoc decisions made under time pressure by actors with misaligned incentives. Planning now creates shared reference points and coordination mechanisms.
