**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create compelling mainstream media content about AI risks with substantial funding directed toward Hollywood professionals (previous discussions with television producers like Ron Moore have occurred but not progressed to completion). Rather than direct advertising (which has the potential to create counterproductive effects), produce a high-budget feature film with extensive input from alignment researchers. The ideal would be reaching broad audiences while maintaining technical accuracy, presenting things faithfully and avoiding the perception of manipulative marketing.

## Why it matters
Mass media shapes public perception more than expert reports. A well-crafted film can create cultural awareness of AI risks that makes policy action politically viable, as happened with climate change and nuclear war.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Discussions with Ron Moore (incomplete)
