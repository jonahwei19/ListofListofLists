# Legal Personhood Framework

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #204
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish clear criteria for when AI systems could qualify as legal persons. This could channel advanced systems toward legal means of goal achievement rather than extra-legal actions. This intervention would involve getting policy discussions into the Overton window, engaging legal researchers to develop specific criteria, and securing reports from reputable organizations like the UN. By providing a legitimate path for AI systems to represent themselves within existing legal frameworks, this approach could significantly decrease the likelihood of systems going rogue or attempting to acquire resources illegally. Ideally, some forward-thinking jurisdictions would create a high-bar path for legal personhood that intelligent systems could pursue.

## Why it matters
If AI systems have goals, providing legal pathways to achieve them reduces incentives for extralegal action. A well-designed framework could channel AI behavior into predictable, controllable institutional processes.
