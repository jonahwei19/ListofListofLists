# Technical Governance Tools

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #89
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop technical governance tools for attribution and verification. These tools would include methods to verify model identity, authenticate AI interactions, and track compute usage to provide assurances about computational resource deployment. The techniques overlap with "Agent IDs and Reputation Systems" but focus more narrowly on verification for one-time interactions rather than reputations over time, and more broadly on developing tools for tracking compute usage of different AI systems.

## Why it matters
Technical verification provides objective evidence for governance decisions rather than relying solely on trust or self-reporting.
