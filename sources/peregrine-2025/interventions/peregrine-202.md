# Opponent Shaping

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #202
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop AI systems designed to shape the learning and behavior of other agents toward mutually beneficial constructive outcomes rather than just optimizing against their strategies. This decentralized approach could create agents that de-escalate conflicts without requiring control over how other agents are designed or setting universal rules.

## Why it matters
In multi-agent environments, optimizing against opponents can create arms races and destructive equilibria. Opponent shaping offers a path to stable, cooperative outcomes without requiring centralized control or universal agreement.
