# AI Development Lifecycle Risk Management Framework

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #111
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Develop comprehensive risk management approaches combining multiple safety interventions for "defense-in-depth" against AI risks. This would integrate measures spanning the entire AI development lifecycle - from training methodology to ongoing monitoring, containment procedures, and continued alignment training. The framework would specify how different technical and governance interventions complement each other to address risk scenarios.

## Why it matters
Individual safety measures have gaps. A defense-in-depth approach ensures that if one safety layer fails, others remain. Without an integrated framework, safety efforts may be duplicative in some areas and leave blind spots in others.
