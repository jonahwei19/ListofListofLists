# Verified Kinetic Actuators

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #62
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop provably safe mechanisms for AI systems to interact with physical environments through robotics and other actuators. As AI systems increasingly control physical infrastructure and machinery, ensuring reliable and predictable operation becomes critical for preventing accidents and misuse. Verification systems for physical AI actions would provide crucial safety guarantees for industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, critical infrastructure systems, and other applications.

## Why it matters
Software failures in physical systems could have catastrophic consequences. Without verification, AI control of robots and machinery creates unacceptable risk profiles.
