# Usage and Incident Monitoring Systems

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #67
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement robust incident monitoring and usage data analysis systems to understand real-world AI utilization patterns. Labs currently avoid deep usage analysis due to legal liability and privacy concerns, creating significant blind spots in risk assessment.

## Why it matters
Replaces theoretical "ivory tower" threat-modeling with data-driven insights from actual usage patterns. Without understanding how systems are actually used, safety measures may miss real-world risks.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (noted as avoided by labs due to liability/privacy concerns)
