# Military and Government Awareness Campaigns

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #186
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Launch targeted social media campaigns showing concerning AI capabilities to key decision-makers in government and military chains of command. These would persistently deliver evidence of AI progress and risk scenarios to officials at levels where they could slow or stall dangerous developments through administrative processes. Rather than general public awareness, these would precisely target individuals with specific authority to delay approvals, permits, or authorizations critical to AI infrastructure expansion.

## Why it matters
Government and military officials control critical chokepoints (permits, approvals, contracts) but may be unaware of AI risks. Targeted awareness campaigns can shift individual decisions that aggregate into meaningful slowdowns.
