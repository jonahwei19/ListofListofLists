# Economic Resilience

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #151
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Address the anticipated economic disruption from AI-driven displacement, expected to manifest significant social backlash within a 3-5 year timeframe. Redesigning social contracts and economic structures to account for radically different AI-driven productivity dynamics represents a critical challenge that requires advance preparation rather than reactive measures. This focuses on near-term shock absorption and stabilization during rapid AI-driven disruption.

## Why it matters
AI-driven automation could cause rapid, widespread job displacement faster than societies can adapt. Without preparation, this could trigger social instability, political backlash, and economic crises that undermine the ability to govern AI development effectively.
