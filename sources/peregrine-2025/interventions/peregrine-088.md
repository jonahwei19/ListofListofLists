# Agent IDs and Reputation Systems

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #88
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement identification mechanisms like "agent IDs" for AI systems, so that it is possible for AI agents to build and maintain reputations. This could help prevent or disincentivize the development of AI agents that attack or exploit other agents, analogous to how humans control exploitation via reputation mechanisms. This approach would allow tracking behavior across interactions and building trust.

## Why it matters
Particularly valuable in scenarios where power remains distributed among different actors. Creates accountability and consequences for AI system behavior over time.
