# Compute Supply Chain

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #123
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Organize key nations in the AI compute supply chain (Netherlands, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, US) to recognize their collective leverage in moderating the pace of AI development. This initiative would involve running workshops through organizations like Safe AI Forum (SAIF) to establish coordination mechanisms between semiconductor manufacturing countries. The goal would be creating practical enforcement mechanisms for any future AI treaties, as control of specialized chips and manufacturing equipment provides one of the few concrete points of leverage.

## Why it matters
The semiconductor supply chain is geographically concentrated and provides a rare chokepoint for AI governance. Countries controlling chip manufacturing have significant leverage that could be used to enforce AI safety requirements, but this leverage is currently uncoordinated.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Safe AI Forum (SAIF) mentioned as potential organizer
