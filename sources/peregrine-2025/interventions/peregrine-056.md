# Misuse Evaluations

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #56
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop highly realistic evaluations for CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) catastrophic misuse scenarios. This involves creating centralized, standardized frameworks for testing advanced AI systems against sophisticated misuse scenarios to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. These evaluations should simulate realistic threats with adversarial intent.

## Why it matters
Current misuse evaluations suffer from a tragedy of the commons where all major AI labs recognize the necessity but lack sufficient individual incentives to fully own the responsibility. Without realistic testing, vulnerabilities remain unknown until exploited.

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (noted as a gap - labs recognize need but no one owns it)
