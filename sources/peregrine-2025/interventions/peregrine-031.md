# AI Security Expert Development

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #31
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Rapidly training and deploying AI security experts who possess a deep understanding of AI technology, acknowledge short timeline implications, demonstrate exceptional competence in their field, and maintain a global cosmopolitan perspective. An initiative like this should aim to cultivate 100-1000 experts by the end of 2027.

## Why it matters
There aren't enough qualified people working on AI safety who understand both the technical details and the urgency. Training programs typically take years, but if timelines are short, we need accelerated pathways to build a critical mass of capable researchers and practitioners who can actually make progress on safety challenges.
