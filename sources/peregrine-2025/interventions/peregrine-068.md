# Global Hardware Verification

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #68
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement reporting and verification requirements for all high-performance computing hardware to create a global monitoring system for AI development. This would require tracking all GPUs, TPUs, and similar processors with more than a specified computational capacity, including retrofitting systems on older models. This requires international collaboration, particularly with major hardware producers including NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Google, and Chinese manufacturers like Huawei.

## Why it matters
Creates comprehensive awareness of which organizations are utilizing advanced computing resources, enabling early detection of potentially concerning development patterns.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (requires coordination with NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Google, Huawei)
