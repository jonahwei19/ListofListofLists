# Autoverification (Lean)

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #173
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop systems that automate formal verification through Lean theorem proving, addressing the critical shortage of skilled Lean programmers worldwide (estimated at only "a few hundred"). By creating automated tools for Lean, the project could enable implementations of current AI architectures with much stronger formal guarantees. Commercial labs are unlikely to prioritize this area despite its importance, making it a particularly neglected yet high-impact direction for safety research.

## Why it matters
Formal verification provides the strongest possible guarantees about system behavior, but requires rare expertise. Automating Lean proof generation could democratize access to formal methods and enable verification at scale.
