# Verified Software for Cyber Resilience

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #168
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop software synthesis systems capable of generating code with machine-checkable proofs that satisfy functional, safety, and security specifications, building directly on DARPA's I2O office work. This approach would address vulnerabilities in embedded systems that form critical computing infrastructure across domains like SCADA systems, medical devices, and communication networks. Formal verification provides a systematic method to counter anticipated AI-enabled cyber threats by creating mathematical models of software behavior and proving the absence of entire vulnerability classes before deployment.

## Why it matters
Traditional testing can't prove the absence of vulnerabilities - it can only find bugs that exist in test cases. Formal verification mathematically proves security properties, eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities that AI-powered attackers might exploit.

## Current state
