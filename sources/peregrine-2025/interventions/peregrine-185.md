# Consensus-Building Evidence for AI Risk

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #185
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create compelling, large-scale demonstrations and empirical studies that make current AI risks vivid and understandable through concrete, uncontrived demonstrations rather than abstract theory or thought-experiments. The goal would be to establish a broad scientific consensus comparable to that of climate change, where an overwhelming majority of experts agree on the existence of severe risks, potentially through Nature-level publications that focus on both specific instances and broader patterns. This research would provide politicians and the public with a firmer evidence base when making claims about scenarios like AI takeover.

## Why it matters
Policy action requires scientific consensus. Climate policy only became viable after decades of consensus-building research. Accelerating this process for AI risk could compress the timeline from awareness to action.

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Who's working on it**: Apollo Research (demonstrations and empirical studies)
