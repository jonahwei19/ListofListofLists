# Nucleic Acid Observatory

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #137
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Expand the Nucleic Acid Observatory concept with multiple teams pursuing different technical approaches to significantly enhance global biosurveillance capabilities. Complementary monitoring systems and centralized international deployment across strategic locations could provide early detection of emerging pathogens or deliberately engineered biological threats. Substantial computing resources and specialized talent are required to analyze the massive datasets generated by environmental sampling, which would close critical gaps in current monitoring systems.

## Why it matters
Environmental nucleic acid monitoring can detect novel pathogens before clinical cases appear. This early warning capability is critical for responding to both natural outbreaks and potential AI-enabled bioweapons.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Nucleic Acid Observatory
