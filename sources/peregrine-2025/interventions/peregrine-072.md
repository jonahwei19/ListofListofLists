# Confidential Computing

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #72
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Process data in trusted execution environments where it cannot be viewed or altered. Making confidential computing easier to implement would enable more secure AI operations across various contexts, while creating technical foundations for establishing trust boundaries around high-risk AI capabilities. This prevents unauthorized access to dangerous functionalities while enabling legitimate research. Broader adoption requires standardized toolkits and frameworks that establish robust contracts and credentials for secure computation.

## Why it matters
Enables sharing and computation without exposure of sensitive data or model weights, creating technical foundations for governance and auditing that don't require trusting all parties.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: A handful of startups (not named)
