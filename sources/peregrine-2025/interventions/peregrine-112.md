**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Construct secure government facilities capable of hosting model weights and other sensitive AI assets. These facilities could serve as repositories for models deemed too dangerous for widespread distribution, or as platforms for government auditing and testing. Access protocols could be tied to government procurement contracts, creating incentives for compliance with safety metrics through market mechanisms. This infrastructure would need to be developed in advance of crises to be available when needed.

## Why it matters
Currently there is no secure government infrastructure for holding dangerous AI models or conducting independent safety evaluations. Without such facilities, governments lack the capability to verify safety claims or securely quarantine models that pose unacceptable risks.
