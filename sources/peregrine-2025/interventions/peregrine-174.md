# Formal Verification of AI Hardware

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #174
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Apply mathematical formal verification to critical AI components and surrounding infrastructure. This would significantly enhance safety guarantees. Focused verification of specific properties like memory safety, transaction timing, and security boundaries is achievable with current techniques. Priority targets should include key computational infrastructure like the Linux kernel or systems controlling critical infrastructure such as electrical grids, creating mathematically proven safety properties.

## Why it matters
Hardware and low-level infrastructure vulnerabilities can undermine all higher-level safety measures. Formal verification at the hardware level provides foundational guarantees that can't be circumvented by software exploits.
