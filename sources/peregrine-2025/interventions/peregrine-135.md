## What it is
Develop broad-spectrum medical interventions, particularly vaccines that protect against entire classes of pathogens rather than specific strains. This represents a critical defense against both natural and engineered biological threats. Significant funding should be directed toward rapid response platforms that can quickly produce targeted countermeasures when novel threats emerge. Creating stockpiles of key generic countermeasures ahead of time would provide valuable time buffers during emerging crises.

## Why it matters
AI could enable the creation of novel pathogens that evade existing vaccines. Broad-spectrum countermeasures that work against entire pathogen classes would provide defense even against engineered threats we cannot anticipate.
