# Support Academic Project Scaling

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #34
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Provide funding and operational support to academic research agendas that work successfully at small scale but aren't being expanded because academics prioritize novel discoveries over scaling existing approaches. MIT's Tenenbaum lab was specifically mentioned as having promising results that languished without proper resources for deployment.

## Why it matters
Academia incentivizes novelty, not scaling. Many promising approaches are proven at small scale but never tested at production scale because scaling isn't academically rewarded. Providing resources specifically for scaling proven approaches could unlock value that's currently stranded in proof-of-concept stage.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: MIT Tenenbaum Lab (as example candidate)
