# Ultra-Reliable AI Evaluation

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #55
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop engineering approaches to achieve high reliability and benchmarking methodologies that efficiently identify edge cases where models fail catastrophically. Current AI benchmarks lack the depth and variety needed to establish true reliability at scale, focusing on 99% accuracy even though "five nines" (99.999%) may be needed for critical systems. Evaluations should probe worst-case adversarial examples without requiring millions of test instances, modeled more like aircraft safety standards than Kaggle competitions.

## Why it matters
Critical systems require reliability guarantees far beyond current benchmarks. Without methods to efficiently find rare failures, deploying AI in high-stakes domains remains unsafe.
