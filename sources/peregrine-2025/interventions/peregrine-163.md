# SL5 Data Center Pilots

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #163
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Run pilot programs for SL5-grade protocols specifically designed for frontier AI systems. These initiatives would focus on developing practical security measures while simultaneously working to reduce the operational costs associated with maintaining such stringent standards. The pilots serve as crucial testing grounds for security frameworks that could eventually become industry standards, enabling labs to protect against unauthorized access while maintaining research velocity. SL4 provides protections to "thwart most standard operations by leading cyber-capable institutions"; SL5 is to resist "top-priority operations by the world's most capable nation-state actors."

## Why it matters
Frontier AI systems may become targets for nation-state adversaries. Current security levels are insufficient against determined, well-resourced attackers. Developing practical SL5 protocols now ensures readiness when capabilities reach critical thresholds.
