# AI R&D Acceleration Threat Modeling

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #110
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Investigate risks associated with the acceleration of AI R&D. These risks may be difficult to characterize empirically but can be approached either as a risk factor for other threats or through loss of control scenarios. Building appropriate models would require studying how quickly capabilities progress through various thresholds and whether preparedness can keep pace. This area needs more concrete threat modeling to move beyond vague concerns about "more R&D being bad" towards specific, actionable insights about acceleration dynamics.

## Why it matters
The pace of AI development is a key variable in whether safety measures can keep up. Without concrete models of how acceleration affects risk, it is difficult to know when development speed becomes dangerous or what interventions might be most effective.
