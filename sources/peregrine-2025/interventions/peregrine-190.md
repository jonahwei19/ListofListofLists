# Reduce the Alignment Tax

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #190
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Create pathways for economically valuable AI applications that don't require compromising on safety. This would require supporting research directions that maintain economic value while steering away from capabilities that significantly increase risks. The ideal would be to develop AI capabilities that deliver economic benefits without pursuing the most dangerous capabilities as viable alternatives to the current development paradigm. This may include focusing on narrow AI models with applications in areas that have clear societal benefits (such as drug discovery), while avoiding capabilities like autonomous agents that operate without supervision.

## Why it matters
When safety measures impose high costs on labs, they're incentivized to cut corners. Reducing the "tax" that safety imposes on competitiveness makes responsible development the economically rational choice.
