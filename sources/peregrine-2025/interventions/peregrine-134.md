# CBRN Access Control

**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Address AI's capacity to lower barriers to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear weapons through specialized restrictions. These restrictions would include investments in infrastructure and personnel to establish comprehensive pandemic detection systems, strengthening traditional safeguards like wastewater sequencing, vaccine stockpiling, and securing critical supply chains. Such measures would provide dual benefits, protecting against potential catastrophic risks while providing near-term public health benefits.

## Why it matters
AI could dramatically lower the barriers to creating CBRN weapons by providing knowledge and planning assistance that was previously restricted. Strengthening access controls and detection systems addresses this threat while also improving general biosecurity.
