# Civilizational Resilience Measures

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #145
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Enhance society's overall ability to withstand disruptive AI impacts by developing comprehensive programs to strengthen society's "immune system" against potential harms from advanced AI. Such measures include securing essential systems from potential cyberattacks that could cause billions in damage, improving detection and response capabilities for novel biological threats, developing protocols for responsible transfer of decision-making to AI systems, and creating redundant systems that maintain functionality during disruptions. The initiative should leverage AI for improved defensive capabilities to maintain a favorable offense-defense balance, with the goal of increasing "G-doom" - the level of intelligence needed to cause catastrophe - through systematic improvements to global resilience.

## Why it matters
A more resilient civilization is harder to catastrophically disrupt. By systematically strengthening societal "immune systems," we can raise the bar for how much capability would be needed to cause civilizational harm.
