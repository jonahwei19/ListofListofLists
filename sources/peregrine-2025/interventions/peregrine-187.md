# Large-Scale Media Campaigns

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #187
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Launch comprehensive media strategies (e.g. $50 million annual spend) to effectively reach target audiences. For comparison, major brands like McDonald's or Coca-Cola spend nearly $1 billion annually on media, though social topics rarely receive such funding. With approximately $250 million (a quarter of corporate spending), a highly successful campaign could be executed, without the flattening restrictions of the corporate communications style.

## Why it matters
AI safety messaging is drastically outspent by corporate communications and anti-regulation campaigns. Comparable funding could shift public perception and create political will for governance at scale.
