# Multi-Agent Interaction Framework

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #57
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop infrastructure for simulating and analyzing multi-agent interactions, with particular focus on preventing emergent cooperation between agents to circumvent safety constraints. As AI systems increasingly interact autonomously at high speeds, robust frameworks are needed for tracking trust, identifying bad actors, and establishing interaction norms. The frameworks would establish protocols for AI systems to verify trustworthiness of other agents, report problematic behavior, and implement collective safety measures across distributed systems.

## Why it matters
Financial transactions, supply chain operations, and information exchange are becoming mediated by interconnected AI systems operating with minimal human oversight. Emergent behaviors between agents could circumvent individual safety measures.
