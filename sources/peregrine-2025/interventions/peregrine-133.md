# Country-Level Consolidation

**Specificity**: Vague

## What it is
Super-lobbying efforts to reduce the number of countries with frontier AI labs through strategic policy interventions. The initiative would establish hardware-level monitoring and verification mechanisms, which would enable a nonproliferation treaty by limiting the number of parties that would need to sign it for any real effect.

## Why it matters
More countries developing frontier AI makes coordination exponentially harder. Limiting frontier development to fewer jurisdictions makes treaties more feasible and verification more tractable.
