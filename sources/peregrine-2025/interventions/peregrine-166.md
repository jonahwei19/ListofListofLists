# Bug-Finding Democratization

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #166
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Procure government-subsidized access to advanced cybersecurity AI tools. This would significantly improve the security posture of critical infrastructure worldwide. Banks and financial institutions should be priority targets for such programs, as preventing AI systems from gaining access to substantial funds would increase the cost and difficulty of malicious activities. By deploying bug-finding AI tools widely, especially in vulnerable sectors, the overall attack surface available to potentially dangerous systems could be substantially reduced. This represents a public good that governments should fund in countries that would otherwise lack resources for such protection.

## Why it matters
Security capabilities are currently concentrated in wealthy organizations and nations. Democratizing access to AI-powered bug-finding tools raises the security floor globally, eliminating easy targets that could serve as entry points for AI-enabled attacks.
