# Backup Planning

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #156
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Design plans to integrate local food systems, infrastructure capabilities, political contexts, and population needs into practical implementation guidelines for maintaining essential services during catastrophic disruptions. Similar to ALLFED, but focused on developing contingency plans for scenarios where AI deployment might catalyze catastrophic events like nuclear conflict, particularly through integration with nuclear command systems or decision protocols. Infrastructure collapse following events like high-altitude electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) would severely disrupt food systems, creating cascading societal failures within weeks.

## Why it matters
AI integration into critical systems (especially military command) creates new pathways to catastrophic failure. Pre-positioned contingency plans for food, infrastructure, and essential services could mean the difference between societal recovery and collapse.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: ALLFED (related work)
