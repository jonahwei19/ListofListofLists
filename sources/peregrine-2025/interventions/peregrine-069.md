# Industry Security

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #69
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create a privately-funded alternative to the chronically underfunded Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) with its meager $15 million budget, focusing on comprehensive oversight of GPU distribution and AI research automation monitoring. This entity would prototype advanced data center surveillance, implement GPU tracking systems, and establish protocols for questioning companies about their research automation capabilities. The organization would create "proposals that are hard and awkward to oppose" to maximize political viability.

## Why it matters
Current government oversight capacity is dramatically underfunded relative to the challenge. A private alternative could move faster and be better resourced.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (Bureau of Industry and Security mentioned as underfunded incumbent)
