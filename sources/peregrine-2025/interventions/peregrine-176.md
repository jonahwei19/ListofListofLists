# Political Action Organization

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #176
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create dedicated political lobbying infrastructure specifically focused on AI security issues. Unlike traditional research organizations with restrictions on political activity due to their tax status (501(c)(3) vs 501(c)(4)), this entity would be explicitly designed for political influence, and could absorb significant funding due to the inherent costs of political campaigns and advocacy.

## Why it matters
Technical solutions require political will to implement. A dedicated lobbying organization can shape legislation, influence regulatory agencies, and build coalitions in ways that research organizations legally cannot.

## Current state
