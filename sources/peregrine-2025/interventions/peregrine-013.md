# Debate Theory

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #13
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop mathematical frameworks like debate theory, which involves interactive proof systems adapted for AI safety. The project would include clearly defining theorem statements, formalizing constraints, and building theories that can withstand scrutiny from both the theoretical computer science and complexity theory communities. It would also include identifying gaps between theoretical results and practical implementation, alongside developing specific conjectures that can be tested.

## Why it matters
Debate is a proposed scalable oversight method where AI systems argue opposing positions and humans judge. For this to work reliably, we need mathematical foundations proving under what conditions the true answer wins. Without rigorous theory, debate could fail in subtle ways at scale or against adversarial systems.
