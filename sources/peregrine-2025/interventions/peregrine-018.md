# AI for AI Safety Research

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #18
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Leverage advanced AI systems to work on AI safety problems themselves, effectively accelerating research beyond human capabilities. This approach would involve deploying substantial computational resources under careful human oversight to allow AI systems to explore safety solutions. While acknowledging the potential risks of creating even more capable systems, this approach recognizes that sufficient human oversight might enable leveraging AI capabilities for safety research.

## Why it matters
If AI capabilities advance faster than human safety research can keep up, using AI to accelerate safety research could be necessary to maintain the safety-capabilities balance. This is a race condition: whoever gets powerful AI first can use it to accelerate their research, so safety researchers may need to use AI assistance to avoid falling behind.
