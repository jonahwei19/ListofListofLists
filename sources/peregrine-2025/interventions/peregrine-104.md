# AI Security Institutes

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #104
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Establish security institutes in more major jurisdictions than those that exist today, to create both the possibility of better local enforcement in addition to collaboration through established lines of communication. Funding and specific implementation mechanisms remain the main issue.

## Why it matters
AI development is global, but oversight capacity is concentrated in a few jurisdictions. Expanding the network of AI security institutes would enable more comprehensive global coverage and create formal channels for international coordination on AI risks.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: UK AI Safety Institute, US AI Safety Institute, and similar bodies exist in some jurisdictions
