# Computing and Infrastructure Investment for Non-Frontier Lab Research

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #35
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish substantial dedicated computing infrastructure for AI security researchers working outside frontier labs, as the concentration of critical infrastructure might create significant barriers for security researchers should their access be revoked. Open-source models may provide sufficient testing grounds for many safety approaches without requiring proprietary access, and the cluster would enable research teams to have access to competitive computational resources. The infrastructure should also be coupled with governance mechanisms that prevent its misuse for purely capabilities-focused research.

## Why it matters
Safety researchers outside major labs lack compute access, limiting what they can study. If access depends on lab cooperation, it can be revoked. Independent compute infrastructure ensures safety research can continue regardless of lab decisions, while governance mechanisms prevent the infrastructure from being used to advance dangerous capabilities.
