# Concrete Risk Visualization

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #180
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Making abstract global catastrophic risks more comprehensible to policymakers and the public requires connecting them to historical precedents that demonstrate real-world impacts. Examples include detailed modeling of contemporary impacts from historical disasters, such as simulating how a present-day Tambora eruption (which caused the 1815-16 "Year Without Summer") would affect modern society. The aim would be to provide concrete and tangible reference points for understanding potential AI disruption scenarios.

## Why it matters
Policymakers struggle with unprecedented risks. Historical analogies and detailed simulations translate abstract AI scenarios into terms that match existing mental models and decision frameworks.
