# AI OSINT

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #65
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Open-source intelligence efforts for AI monitoring, including tracking compute hardware (especially GPUs) moving through countries like Turkey into Russia and China. Organizations like Sentinel and Bellingcat would be ideal for developing internet scrapers to uncover hidden developments, like OpenAI hiring physics professors in South Korea. AI-powered scrapers could detect emerging threats such as AI-generated romantic videos or increasingly sophisticated AI-powered scam tools becoming available for sale.

## Why it matters
Provides relatively cheap intelligence without requiring unilateralist action, making it politically feasible while revealing where regulatory or governance levers might be needed.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Sentinel, Bellingcat (mentioned as ideal candidates)
