# Vulnerability Patching Systems

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #164
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop enhanced mechanisms for rapidly identifying and addressing software vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by increasingly capable AI systems. These systems create incentives for vulnerability disclosure, develop automated detection of potential security gaps, and improve deployment of patches across critical infrastructure.

## Why it matters
AI systems could dramatically accelerate vulnerability discovery and exploitation. Faster patching cycles and better disclosure incentives are necessary to maintain defensive parity as AI-powered offensive capabilities improve.
