# Academia-Industry Translation

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #29
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish effective mechanisms to transfer AI security research outputs from academic institutions to commercial applications. Currently, the handoff between these sectors is notably weak, causing valuable security innovations to remain theoretical rather than implemented in production systems. This initiative would focus on creating standardized processes and incentives to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation. Literature alone often isn't enough, since findings can rely on closed weights/data, lack reproducible code and benchmarks tied to deployment constraints, and don't map to security/compliance requirements.

## Why it matters
Academic safety research often never gets deployed because there's no systematic pathway to implementation. Companies don't have resources to translate academic findings, and academics aren't incentivized to make their work deployment-ready. This gap means potentially valuable safety techniques sit unused while deployed systems remain vulnerable.
