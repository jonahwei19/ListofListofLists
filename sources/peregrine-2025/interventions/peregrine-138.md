## What it is
Accelerate all necessary biological defenses, modeled after Alvea Corp's approach. This would involve comprehensive biological threat assessment, preparation of defensive countermeasures, and rapid response capabilities. The project aims to provide confidence that biological risks accelerated by AI capabilities can be effectively contained and mitigated, working across public health systems, research institutions, and biotechnology development.

## Why it matters
AI could accelerate the development of biological threats faster than traditional biodefense can respond. Comprehensive acceleration of all biological countermeasures is needed to maintain defense-offense balance.
