# Control as a Service

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #22
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Build a third-party service organization that provides forward-deployed engineers to help implement Redwood control techniques and other safety measures. This approach would make adoption of control mechanisms easier for companies by providing implementation expertise rather than just recommendations.

## Why it matters
Safety research often produces techniques that are never adopted because companies lack implementation expertise or resources. By providing engineers who can directly implement safety measures, this removes the barrier between research and deployment, ensuring safety techniques actually get used rather than sitting in papers.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (builds on Redwood Research work)
