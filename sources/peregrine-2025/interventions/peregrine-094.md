# Addressing AI Crawling Challenges

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #94
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop industry standards and technical solutions for managing how AI systems access and index web content. This includes addressing issues around blocking unauthorized crawling activities, preventing data harvesting that violates creator intent, and establishing ethical norms for training data collection. Several groups are already taking independent action but lack coordination. The project would create consensus around acceptable crawling practices, technical enforcement mechanisms, and could include compensation models for content creators.

## Why it matters
Without standards, data collection for training remains a free-for-all that ignores creator rights and undermines trust in AI systems.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Several groups (not specified, noted as lacking coordination)
