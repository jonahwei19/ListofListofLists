# Incident Reporting

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #87
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement a robust incident reporting framework for AI systems alongside standardized mechanisms and procedures for documenting, analyzing, and sharing information about AI failures, misuse, or unexpected behaviors. The framework would enable cross-organizational learning from incidents, develop taxonomies to establish severity classifications, and facilitate coordinated responses to emerging threats. Similar to aviation safety reporting systems, it would ideally include protections for whistleblowers and requirements for timely disclosure.

## Why it matters
Without standardized reporting, lessons from incidents remain siloed and the same mistakes get repeated. Aviation's safety record demonstrates the value of mandatory, protected reporting.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (requires buy-in from major AI labs, coordinated regulatory frameworks)
