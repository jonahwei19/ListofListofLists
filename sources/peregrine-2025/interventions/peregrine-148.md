# Citizen Assemblies for Global Catastrophic Risks

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #148
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Have ordinary citizens receive expert briefings and engage in extended deliberation on complex issues to distill complex ideas into implementable solutions while maintaining legitimacy through representative public involvement. This approach tends to result in outcomes that enjoy broader public acceptance than top-down approaches and could result in more resilience to global catastrophes, including ones related to advanced AI systems.

## Why it matters
AI governance decisions made by small groups of experts may lack democratic legitimacy and miss important perspectives. Citizen assemblies can produce well-informed public judgment that has broader acceptance and may identify considerations experts overlook.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (citizen assembly methodology exists but not widely applied to AI/GCR)
