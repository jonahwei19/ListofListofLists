# Personnel Reliability Programs

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #200
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Mandate screening and monitoring personnel who have access to powerful AI systems, drawing parallels to security clearances in other sensitive domains such as intelligence or cybersecurity. The primary goal would be to eliminate some of the worst outcomes from geopolitical adversaries or mentally unstable individuals having access to AGI-level systems, with unclear effects on the lab's AI security overall.

## Why it matters
Insider threats are among the most difficult to defend against. Personnel screening reduces the probability that bad actors gain access to critical systems, though it trades off against talent acquisition and organizational culture.
