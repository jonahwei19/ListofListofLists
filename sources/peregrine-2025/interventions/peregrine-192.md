# Access Standards

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #192

**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop standardized interfaces for the AI ecosystem akin to the universality of USB-C, establishing consistent ways to interact with all models regardless of their origin. Currently, each lab uses different interfaces for their models, forcing third-party auditors and researchers to negotiate separate access arrangements with each company, potentially delaying critical safety work by months. Standardization would enable auditors to promptly assess new models, researchers to consistently compare systems, and developers to build compatible tools across the ecosystem. This standardization effort could be implemented "within a year."

## Why it matters
Fragmented interfaces slow safety research and auditing. Every lab using different APIs means duplicated work, delayed assessments, and incompatible safety tools. Standardization enables the ecosystem to move at the speed of the fastest developer rather than the slowest integrator.
