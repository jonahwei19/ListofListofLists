# Speed Limits in Data Centers

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #63
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement technical restrictions on computing speed in data centers to slow capability advancement and buy time for safety research. This approach tackles a wide range of problems at once by directly limiting the pace of AI development.

## Why it matters
Buys time for safety research to catch up with capability development. Addresses the root cause of racing dynamics by throttling the infrastructure itself.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (noted as having significant political and coordination barriers, with expected strong pushback from labs)
