# Legal Authority Clarification

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #106
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop clear frameworks specifying which government agencies would have jurisdiction and authority to intervene in dangerous AI development. In the US, different agencies (DOD vs. DOE) would approach control very differently, making this determination crucial for effective governance. The project would also address who should be involved in oversight, including Congress, the public, and international allies, with current defaults likely favoring excessive exclusion. The goal would be producing ranked intervention plans that balance effectiveness with maintaining proper checks on power.

## Why it matters
In a crisis scenario involving dangerous AI, unclear jurisdiction could lead to paralysis or conflicting responses. Establishing clear authority ahead of time ensures rapid, coordinated action is possible when needed.
