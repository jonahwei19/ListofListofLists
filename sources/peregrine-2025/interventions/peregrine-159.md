# Model Weight Security

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #159
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Strengthen the security of model weights across data centers and other critical infrastructure. Ensuring that security implementations are deployed at data centers and other places where model weights are stored to prevent catastrophic leaks that could enable everything from targeted cyber attacks to large-scale societal disruption. Current best practices exist but remain unevenly implemented, and rising capability levels make this increasingly important.

## Why it matters
Model weights represent the core capability of frontier AI systems. A leak enables adversaries to bypass years of safety work, fine-tune away guardrails, or deploy dangerous capabilities without oversight. This is a single point of failure for the entire safety stack.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Various labs and security groups (unevenly implemented)
