# Data Rights Systems

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #98
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish frameworks for compensating individuals whose data is used in AI training, particularly focusing on high-skilled or vulnerable sector labor contributions. The ideal system would be "incentive compatible" while providing "good data and good oversight." This work specifically focuses on compensation and rights for individuals whose data trains AI models, not broader questions of who owns AI-generated economic value.

## Why it matters
Creates economic returns for data contributors while ensuring quality data governance. Addresses fairness concerns about AI systems profiting from others' contributions.
