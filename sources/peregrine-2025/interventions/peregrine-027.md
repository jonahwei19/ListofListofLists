# Loss of Control Threat Modeling

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #27
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Run extensive threat-modeling experiments for loss-of-control scenarios, including honeypot experiments in realistic sandboxes that simulate AI systems interacting with each other. These simulations could reveal whether systems develop concerning behaviors like cooperation for deception or capability for jailbreaking other systems.

## Why it matters
We don't know what loss of control would actually look like or how it would unfold. Concrete threat modeling with realistic simulations can identify specific failure modes, test whether proposed defenses work, and reveal unexpected risks like emergent cooperation between AI systems against human oversight.
