# Task Decomposition

**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Break up potentially dangerous AI tasks into multiple components distributed across different users or systems, none having complete capability independently, using architectural approaches. This compartmentalization would prevent any single actor from executing highly dangerous operations while still enabling complex beneficial tasks through carefully designed interfaces and information controls.

## Why it matters
Even if individual AI systems are compromised or misused, architectural decomposition ensures no single point of failure can enable catastrophic outcomes. This provides defense-in-depth by design rather than relying solely on alignment or access controls.
