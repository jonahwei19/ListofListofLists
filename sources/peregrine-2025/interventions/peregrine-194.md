# Cooperative AI Mechanism Design

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #194
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Develop mechanisms that enable diverse AI systems and human actors to cooperate effectively with one another in increasingly complex global environments, with the result being that "all kinds of actors become empowered." This research agenda assumes that the world won't be faced with a single superintelligence with little ability to influence the outside world, but rather numerous AI systems interacting in ways difficult to predict.

## Why it matters
A multi-agent AI future requires cooperation mechanisms that don't exist today. Without them, competitive dynamics could lead to races-to-the-bottom on safety or coordination failures with catastrophic consequences.
