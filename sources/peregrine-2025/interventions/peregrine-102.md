# Academic-National Lab Cooperation

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #102
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Adopt a hybrid model that combines university-driven theoretical innovation with laboratory-driven practical deployment to create accelerated paths for transitioning academic concepts into operational security measures within critical timeframes. University research excels at capability demonstration but struggles with practical implementation, whereas national laboratories provide essential implementation expertise but are often constrained by bureaucratic processes.

## Why it matters
There is a gap between academic AI safety research and real-world deployment. Academic institutions produce theoretical insights that never get implemented, while national labs have deployment capacity but lack cutting-edge ideas. Bridging this gap could dramatically accelerate the translation of safety research into operational measures.
