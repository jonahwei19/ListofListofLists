# Legal Clarity Initiatives

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #188
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Preemptively litigate against AI organizations deemed negligent regarding risk management, potentially recruiting high-profile figures like Elon Musk to sue companies developing or releasing dangerous open-source models. File strategic lawsuits across multiple jurisdictions to establish precedents and create legal clarity around AI risk management requirements.

## Why it matters
Legal uncertainty allows labs to ignore risks. Strategic litigation establishes precedents that clarify liability, create deterrence, and provide legal hooks for future regulatory action.
