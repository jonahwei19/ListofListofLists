# AI Diffusion Research

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #66
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Conduct comprehensive research on the dynamics and limitations of AI capability diffusion. This work would analyze to what extent powerful capabilities will inevitably spread versus remain concentrated, examining hardware requirements, data access limitations, and algorithmic innovations. The project would track diffusion patterns of current capabilities while developing predictive models for how future capabilities might spread.

## Why it matters
Informs containment and governance strategies by understanding what can actually be controlled versus what will spread regardless of intervention.
