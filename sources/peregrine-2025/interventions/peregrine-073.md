# Privacy-Preserving Verification Systems

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #73
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement surveillance, monitoring and verification technologies that track hardware supply chains, chip deployments, power grid construction, and computing infrastructure globally. The initiative would combine both OSINT and privacy-preserving cryptographic methods to verify what activities are occurring inside data centers. Distribution of information would be handled through diplomatic channels rather than complete public disclosure to avoid triggering adversarial reactions.

## Why it matters
Provides transparency to prevent miscalculations between major powers, preventing countries from accelerating AI development out of fear others are doing the same. Collects critical intelligence about AI development capacity.
