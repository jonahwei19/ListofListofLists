# Global Immune System

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #141
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create next-generation wearables for host response-based diagnosis that detect physiological anomalies indicating infection, even without identifying the specific pathogen. Rather than competing with commercial wearables, this effort would identify additional measurements beyond current capabilities and determine how to operationalize existing devices for an early warning biodefense ecosystem. The approach leverages existing wearable technology momentum and user acceptance while developing missing technological components and protocols to transform the current ecosystem into a distributed global immune system. This capability addresses the fundamental challenge: "What do you look for when you don't know what you're looking for?"

## Why it matters
Novel or engineered pathogens may evade specific diagnostic tests. A system that detects infection through host response rather than pathogen identification could provide early warning for any biological threat, including those we cannot anticipate.
