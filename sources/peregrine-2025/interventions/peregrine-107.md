# Government Support Framework

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #107
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Vague

## What it is
Create mechanisms to shape how governments support AI lab security through external lobbying bodies. This idea currently lacks significant lab buy-in. This work would need organizations that understand both government regulation mechanics and the technical work involved in AI development and security.

## Why it matters
Government support for AI lab security could provide resources and legitimacy that labs currently lack, but the mechanisms for delivering this support do not exist. Creating effective frameworks for government-lab cooperation on security could strengthen overall AI safety.
