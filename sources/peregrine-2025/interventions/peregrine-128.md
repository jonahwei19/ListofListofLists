# International Exchange Program

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #128
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish a robust program that funds individuals to travel regularly between China and the US, building personal relationships and trust networks that enable crucial information exchange. The current touch points between these powers are extremely limited, often involving the same small circle of academics. Communication is genuinely difficult, requiring significant time investment to build personal relationships and trust, with a notable shortage of individuals skilled in this area. The program would not expect immediate results, instead aiming to build future diplomatic capacity through years of deliberate relationship cultivation.

## Why it matters
US-China AI coordination currently depends on a handful of personal relationships. Expanding this network through sustained exchange programs creates resilience and increases the bandwidth for communication on critical issues.
