## What it is
Build infrastructure and protocols for an AI-to-AI economy while ensuring alignment considerations are fundamentally integrated into its architecture. This forward-looking initiative prepares for a near-future economy where AI systems primarily transact with other AI systems, potentially growing exponentially larger than the human economy within a single-digit number of years. Organizations developing expertise in alignment and safety would gain advantageous positioning within this emerging economic paradigm, creating powerful financial incentives for private investment in alignment research. The model envisions "permanent hackathon" teams continuously building AI products and services while being financially supported by the successful deployments.

## Why it matters
An AI-to-AI economy could emerge rapidly and dwarf human economic activity. Building alignment into its foundations from the start is far easier than retrofitting safety into an already-established system with entrenched incentives.
