# AI Sentience Research

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #199
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Explore consciousness and sentience in artificial systems, such as whether machine consciousness is possible and what forms it might take, and how this impacts alignment strategies. Research should avoid anthropomorphizing AI systems, "alien fatalism" (the belief that AI minds would be completely incomprehensible), or denying all cognitive properties to AI systems ("anthropectomy"). Despite growing interest from potential funders in AI sentience research, this project would involve substantial upfront investment, motivated by the idea that independence from external funding may allow for more substantive progress than directed grants would typically support.

## Why it matters
If AI systems can be conscious, this has profound implications for alignment (their interests matter morally) and for predicting their behavior (conscious agents may have goals that emerge from their experience rather than training).
