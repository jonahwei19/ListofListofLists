# Large Group Deliberation Systems

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #146
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop systems for collective decision-making involving large groups of people which are essential for maintaining distributed power in the face of rapid AI advancement. These tools should involve extensive testing with real humans to iteratively improve understanding of effective processes, making it possible to engage people quickly and efficiently when important decisions need to be made rather than defaulting to concentrated power.

## Why it matters
Important AI governance decisions may need to be made quickly but should still reflect broad input. Without effective large-group deliberation systems, the choice is between slow democratic processes and fast autocratic decisions.
