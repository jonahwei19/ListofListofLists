# AI-Enhanced Monitoring

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #83
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Deploy AI systems that continuously monitor other AI systems, looking for anomalous behaviors or market activities that might indicate concerning capabilities developments. This surveillance network would function as a de facto surveillance system and network of private investigators, aiming to catch anomalous AI behaviors as early as possible. Implementation would require web-scale scraping expertise, drawing from DEFCON-style talent pools to turn this into competitive challenges to identify hidden compute resources akin to capture-the-flag competitions.

## Why it matters
Human monitoring cannot scale to the speed and complexity of AI-to-AI interactions. AI-powered surveillance enables detection at necessary scale.
