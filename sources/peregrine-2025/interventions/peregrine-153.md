# AI Displacement Response Planning

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #153
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop comprehensive approaches to address workforce displacement resulting from AI advancement. This initiative would create frameworks for identifying vulnerable sectors, quantifying impact timelines, and implementing retraining programs before mass displacement occurs. Analysis suggests particular risk of large scale displacement within the next three years, with K-curve effects (widening inequality) potentially accelerating within 18 months. The work would engage multiple stakeholders including government agencies, educational institutions, industry leaders, and labor organizations to create coordinated responses that manage transition periods and prevent severe socioeconomic disruption.

## Why it matters
Without coordinated planning, mass displacement could arrive faster than institutions can respond, creating cascading failures across social safety nets, political systems, and economic stability. Proactive frameworks enable targeted interventions in vulnerable sectors before crisis hits.
