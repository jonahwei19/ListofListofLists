# Hardware Kill Switches and Location Tracking

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #74
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement monitoring systems to track the location and usage of AI-specific hardware combined with technical 'kill switches' that can remotely disable GPUs. The approach involves tracking specific hardware shipments and movements, providing intelligence on compute scaling that could inform when and where to apply regulatory levers.

## Why it matters
Provides states with crucial information about attempts to circumvent agreements on compute governance, and the technical ability to halt undesirable AI development. Enables state visibility, compliance verification, and ability to halt unauthorized compute.

## Current state
