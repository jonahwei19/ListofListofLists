# International Protocols for AI Treaties

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #126
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Develop hardware and protocols that would enable international auditing of future AI treaties. This infrastructure would support verification mechanisms for international agreements, similar to nuclear non-proliferation approaches. US-China dialogues particularly need scaling and formalization to prevent dangerous competitive dynamics. Hardware components, potentially coupled with new verification technologies, were mentioned as key bottlenecks for verification to operate in spite of geopolitical tensions.

## Why it matters
International AI treaties are meaningless without verification. Developing the technical infrastructure for verification now ensures that when political will for treaties emerges, the mechanisms to enforce them will be ready.
