# International Governance Trifecta

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #121
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Establish predecessor organizations to international AI governance bodies modeled after existing entities like the IAEA and ISS. The project would aim to reduce competitive pressures in AI development by creating mechanisms for international agreement verification, partially enabled by flexible hardware governance technologies. By removing some "fuel from the race," these governance structures could provide critical time and stability for implementing additional safety measures while establishing the foundation for longer-term international coordination.

## Why it matters
International AI governance institutions do not exist and cannot be created overnight. Building predecessor organizations now creates the foundation for formal governance bodies when the political will emerges, while providing immediate coordination benefits.
