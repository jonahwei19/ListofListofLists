# Protection of Global Security Weak Points

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #170
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Strengthen the weakest links in global security infrastructure to reduce the overall attack surface available to potentially dangerous systems. A sophisticated AI system seeking autonomy would likely target jurisdictions with weaker security measures rather than well-defended systems in developed countries. The most plausible scenario involves systems acquiring computing resources in regions where corruption enables easier access and less oversight. This suggests the need for global security standards and offering to fund security improvements in countries that would otherwise lack resources.

## Why it matters
Global security is only as strong as its weakest link. An AI system seeking resources or escape would rationally target poorly-defended jurisdictions. Strengthening these weak points eliminates low-cost attack vectors.
