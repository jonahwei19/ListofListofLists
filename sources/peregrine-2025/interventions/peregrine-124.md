# Intergovernmental Frontier Model Forum

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #124
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Allocate large amounts of funding (on the order of hundreds of millions of USD) to METR, while developing an international version of the Frontier Model Forum structured like the WHO but specifically focused on AI threat models. Unlike the current Forum which lacks involvement from key players like DeepSeek and xAI, this organization would abandon the exclusive membership model in favor of universal participation to effectively facilitate international treaty development and red line enforcement before concerns like biological weapons uplift become critical concerns.

## Why it matters
The current Frontier Model Forum excludes key players, limiting its effectiveness. A WHO-like body with universal participation could set and enforce global standards for frontier AI development, preventing a race to the bottom on safety.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: METR, Frontier Model Forum (existing but limited)
