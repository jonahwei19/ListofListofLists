# AI Misuse Detection Systems

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #81
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create systems to identify and address AI misuse before "mini-catastrophes" such as market manipulation, coordinated influence operations, or novel cyberattack patterns. This requires developing technical infrastructure and monitoring systems to track patterns of usage across AI ecosystems, flagging suspicious activity patterns, indications of weaponization, and proactive checks for "weird AI behavior" in the wild. The systems need both technical mechanisms for detection and human evaluation processes to distinguish genuine innovations from potential threats.

## Why it matters
Functions as a safety net for catching misuse scenarios that weren't explicitly anticipated in initial safety evaluations. Brings concrete evidence of risks to light sooner, potentially motivating political action before more severe incidents occur.
