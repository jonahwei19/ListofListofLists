# Human Productivity

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #150
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Developing technical systems to help humans remain economically productive in an AI-dominated economy requires rethinking how people interface with technology. The focus should shift from replacing humans to creating augmentation systems that leverage uniquely human capabilities while using AI to enhance productivity. This includes designing interfaces that amplify human judgment, creativity, and supervision capabilities, potentially allowing individuals to manage multiple AI systems simultaneously. This work would focus on preventing displacement by building augmentation systems that keep humans economically relevant rather than replacing them.

## Why it matters
If AI simply replaces human labor, the result is unemployment. If AI augments human capabilities, workers can remain productive and economically valuable. The design of human-AI interfaces will determine which outcome occurs.
