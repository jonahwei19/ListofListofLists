## What it is
Create governance frameworks for distributing ownership of AI-driven productivity as a step to avoid extreme inequality. These systems would determine how benefits from AI labor are shared across society when traditional employment may no longer be the primary distribution mechanism. Potential approaches include public ownership of foundation models, mandated profit-sharing from AI deployment, or novel structures like data dividends. This addresses the distribution of AI-driven productivity and capital gains at the societal level.

## Why it matters
If AI dramatically increases productivity but the gains flow only to capital owners, the result could be extreme inequality and social instability. Designing ownership and distribution frameworks in advance could prevent this outcome.
