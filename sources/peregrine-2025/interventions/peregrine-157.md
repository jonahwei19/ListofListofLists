# Build the Off Button

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #157

**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Build a universal "off button" as a critical line of defense when all other safety layers fail. While it may be challenging to implement (especially for systems potentially smarter than humans), containment measures may well fail, necessitating emergency shutdown capabilities.

## Why it matters
All safety measures have failure modes. A reliable shutdown mechanism provides a final backstop when alignment, containment, and monitoring all fail. Without it, there's no recovery path from certain failure scenarios.
