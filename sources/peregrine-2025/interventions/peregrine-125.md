# EU Diplomatic Capacity

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #125
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Empower the EU AI office and External Action Service (EEAS) to position Europe as a credible third pole in global AI governance. Switzerland's unique diplomatic position makes it one of the few truly neutral parties that could credibly signal to China, unlike Singapore which may not maintain sufficient neutrality. The EU could play a critical role in negotiating supply chain agreements and establishing verification mechanisms, potentially hosting third-party auditors trusted by both the US and China. EU diplomatic capacity was noted as increasingly valuable in light of US-China contact potentially becoming more challenging.

## Why it matters
US-China AI tensions risk creating a bifurcated world where safety standards diverge. The EU could serve as a neutral broker and third pole, maintaining communication channels and setting standards that both sides might accept.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: EU AI Office, External Action Service (EEAS)
