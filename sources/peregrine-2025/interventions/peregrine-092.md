# Enhanced Responsible Scaling Implementation

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #92
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Transform existing Responsible Scaling Policies (RSPs) from theoretical frameworks into actionable implementation plans. Develop concrete, tested "if-then commitments" with ready-to-deploy protocols for when safety boundaries are approached, and build social mechanisms including public accountability and transparency requirements to ensure compliance. Significant focus on creating industry-wide norms and social pressure that makes non-compliance reputationally costly.

## Why it matters
Current RSPs are theoretical commitments without tested implementation. Without concrete protocols and enforcement mechanisms, commitments may not be honored under pressure.

## Current state
- **Status**: Pilot
- **Who's working on it**: Not specified (various labs have RSPs but implementation varies)
