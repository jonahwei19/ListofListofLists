# Reward Track Record in Security & Safety Organizations

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #32
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement a structured three-year funding schedule for alignment research organizations to signal long-term commitment and allow organizations to plan strategic growth. Example targets for substantially increased funding for proven alignment research organizations include Transluce, Apollo, and Redwood.

## Why it matters
Safety research organizations struggle with uncertain, short-term funding that prevents strategic planning and makes it hard to retain talent. Long-term funding commitments allow organizations to make multi-year hires, pursue ambitious projects, and build institutional capacity rather than constantly scrambling for the next grant.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: Transluce, Apollo, Redwood (as potential recipients)
