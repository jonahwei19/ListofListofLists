# Open-Source AI Drift Monitoring

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #79
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop open-source tools to detect, measure, and address gradual changes in model behavior over time. This initiative would establish standard metrics and benchmarks for identifying when models begin to deviate from their intended function or otherwise exhibit concerning behaviors. Create a tool that provides transparent, vendor-neutral assessment of model drift across different AI systems.

## Why it matters
Helps organizations maintain oversight of their AI deployments and intervene before drift creates significant security vulnerabilities.
