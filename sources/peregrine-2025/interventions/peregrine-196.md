# New AI-Human Interaction Theory

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #196
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Integrate communication constraints and computational limitations in ways current game theory doesn't address. Just as game theory was developed during the Cold War to model nuclear deterrence, new mathematical frameworks may be needed to understand interactions between powerful AI systems and humans. The mathematical models would help analyze equilibria in multi-agent systems where computational capacity itself becomes a strategic resource, providing formal tools to understand stability and safety in worlds with increasingly autonomous systems.

## Why it matters
Existing game theory assumes roughly equal computational capacity among players. AI systems break this assumption. New theoretical frameworks are needed to understand strategic interactions where one party has vastly superior computational abilities.
