# Physical Security Mechanisms

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #143
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop physical security measures that constrain bioweapons and similar threats at the material level, rather than focusing on software-based solutions. Self-replicating vaccines that transmit like normal viruses could be developed as a potential solution for novel bio-threats enabled by increasingly capable AI systems. This approach requires funding for experts who take the potential capabilities of near-future AI systems seriously, and investment towards substantial research programs aimed at moving beyond the current biological literature for defensive technologies. The goal should be developing interventions that can address qualitatively different threats compared to anything seen before, rather than merely extending existing biosecurity frameworks.

## Why it matters
Software controls can be bypassed, but physical constraints on biological materials are harder to circumvent. Transmissible vaccines and other physical security mechanisms could provide defense even against sophisticated AI-enabled biological attacks.
