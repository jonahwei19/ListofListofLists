# Defense-in-Depth for Closed Source Models

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #161
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Implement "Swiss cheese layered" defense approaches to make closed source models harder to misuse. This creates multiple protective barriers that, while individually imperfect, collectively strengthen security. Models remain vulnerable to determined attackers, but raising difficulty levels creates meaningful deterrence. The strategy acknowledges open-source models will remain exploitable but focuses on practical protection layers for controlled systems.

## Why it matters
No single safety measure is foolproof. Layered defenses ensure that circumventing one barrier still leaves multiple obstacles, dramatically increasing the cost and difficulty of misuse while maintaining usability for legitimate purposes.
