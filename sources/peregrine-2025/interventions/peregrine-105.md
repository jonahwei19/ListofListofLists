# Risk Assessments

**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Persuade governments to incorporate AI-driven catastrophic scenarios into official risk frameworks. Most national risk assessments focus exclusively on conventional threats like floods and earthquakes, systematically overlooking emerging technological risks including advanced AI systems. These assessments directly influence critical resource allocation decisions regarding infrastructure investments, research funding priorities, and emergency preparedness capabilities. Engaging directly with government risk assessment agencies represents a force-multiplier for resilience funding, potentially redirecting billions in existing funding toward relevant preparedness measures.

## Why it matters
Government risk frameworks determine where billions of dollars flow for preparedness and resilience. If AI catastrophic risks are not included in these frameworks, they will remain systematically underfunded compared to conventional threats like natural disasters.
