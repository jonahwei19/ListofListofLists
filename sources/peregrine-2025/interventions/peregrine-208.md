# Defenses Against Nanotech Threats

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #208
**Specificity**: Vague

## What it is
Create defenses against future nanoscale technologies. While currently speculative, establishing early research and monitoring capabilities provides valuable lead time for addressing these threats, in the event they do materialize.

## Why it matters
Advanced AI could accelerate nanotechnology development. Establishing defensive research now provides lead time if nanotech threats emerge, rather than starting from zero when the risk becomes acute.
