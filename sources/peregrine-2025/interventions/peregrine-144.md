## What it is
Scale research capacity to enable developing coherent resilience frameworks tailored to different regional vulnerabilities. Currently only ALLFED and a handful of other organizations conduct focused research on societal resilience to catastrophic disruptions, creating dangerous knowledge gaps in critical preparedness areas. Matt Boyd's research group (Adapt Research Ltd.) in New Zealand and Penn State's nuclear winter research program represent the only other significant academic efforts investigating large-scale resilience strategies. These efforts remain dramatically underfunded relative to the scale of potential risks, with research topics ranging from alternative food production to critical infrastructure protection.

## Why it matters
Society is not prepared for catastrophic disruptions that AI could cause or accelerate. Without scaled research into resilience, we lack the knowledge to maintain essential functions through major crises.

## Current state
- **Status**: Research
- **Who's working on it**: ALLFED, Adapt Research Ltd. (Matt Boyd), Penn State nuclear winter program
