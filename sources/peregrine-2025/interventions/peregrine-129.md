# Track 2 Diplomacy

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #129

**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Fund unofficial diplomatic channels between major countries on AI development (especially the US and China) to build relationships and identify potential agreement points before formal negotiations. Formal government negotiations may move too slowly given rapid technological development timelines, whereas this approach offers the promise of establishing more potential points of agreement ahead of official international negotiations. The goal would be building sufficient mutual understanding and trust between powers, with a more direct focus on government officials who may be influential when it comes to pursuing formal agreements on development limitations and safety standards.

## Why it matters
Official diplomatic channels are slow and constrained by political considerations. Track 2 diplomacy can explore potential agreements and build trust without the constraints of official positions, laying groundwork for faster formal negotiations when the time comes.
