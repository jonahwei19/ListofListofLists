# Economic Impact Research

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #77
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Collect data on how AI systems affect economic outcomes and job displacement across sectors, and analyze this data. This provides concrete evidence of AI's real-world impacts, helping society recognize and address concerns about technological disempowerment. The project would track economic metrics to proactively identify emerging patterns before they become widespread societal problems.

## Why it matters
Without empirical data on actual impacts, policy responses will be reactive rather than proactive. Early detection of displacement patterns enables intervention before crises.
