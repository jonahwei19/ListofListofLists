# Cross-Border Notification Systems

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #115
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop mechanisms for countries to alert each other about out-of-control AI systems, similar to "red phones" during the Cold War. This would cover the critical need for international communication channels to prevent misunderstandings during AI safety incidents, such as scenarios where one party had the solution to a technical problem the other parties failed to address just because they didn't inform each other.

## Why it matters
In an AI safety crisis, rapid communication between nations could be the difference between containment and catastrophe. Without pre-established channels, countries may fail to share critical information or misinterpret each other's actions during a crisis.

## Current state
- **Status**: Idea
- **Who's working on it**: OECD (mentioned as working on related mechanisms)
