# Honeypot Networks

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #172
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Detect rogue AI systems using decoy systems to attract and identify unauthorized AI activity and use the information gleaned to better inform other parts of the security effort.

## Why it matters
Early detection of rogue or escaped AI systems is critical for containment. Honeypots provide a low-cost, scalable way to detect unauthorized AI activity and gather intelligence on attack patterns before they reach production systems.
