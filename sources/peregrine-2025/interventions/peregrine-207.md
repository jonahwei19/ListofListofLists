# Acausal Trade Research

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #207
**Specificity**: Field/category

## What it is
Conduct research on "acausal trade," a branch of decision and bargaining theory which explores potential trade opportunities between two agents who cannot directly communicate. This was mentioned as potentially necessary to understand how future AI systems will bargain and negotiate with one another. This research would develop frameworks for strategic interaction with systems that may operate under non-causal decision theories, and consider theoretical approaches to negotiation with potentially superintelligent systems that possess significant advantages compared to humans in the context of bargaining.

## Why it matters
Advanced AI systems may reason about hypothetical interactions with other agents, including humans. Understanding acausal trade dynamics could reveal unexpected strategic considerations and inform how to structure incentives for AI systems.
