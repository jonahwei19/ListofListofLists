# Diversify the Security Research Portfolio

**Specificity**: Vague

## What it is
Aim to mirror R&D in other high-stakes domains like vaccine development, where multiple concurrent paths were pursued during the COVID pandemic. Rather than betting on a single technical solution to AI security, distribute resources across many parallel approaches.

## Why it matters
We don't know which alignment approach will work. Concentrating resources on a single approach is high-risk: if it fails, there's no backup. Portfolio diversification across multiple technical approaches provides insurance against any single approach failing, similar to how vaccine development pursued multiple candidates simultaneously.
