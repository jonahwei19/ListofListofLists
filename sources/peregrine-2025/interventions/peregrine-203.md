# Autonomous Weapons Monitoring

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #203
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Establish comprehensive monitoring systems for AI applications in weaponry to help prevent particularly dangerous military applications. Such monitoring would track development of autonomous decision-making capabilities in weapons systems, creating transparency about which systems maintain meaningful human oversight versus fully autonomous operation. Implementation would require international agreements, technical verification methods, and mechanisms to limit proliferation of the most dangerous systems. This monitoring would be particularly crucial for preventing scenarios where autonomous systems engage in conflict escalation without human intervention.

## Why it matters
Autonomous weapons that can escalate conflicts without human authorization create catastrophic risks. Monitoring provides early warning and creates accountability that can deter the most dangerous developments.
