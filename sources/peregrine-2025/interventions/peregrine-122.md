# Geopolitical Sense-Making

**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Create robust information-sharing platforms that help stakeholders understand critical developments like DeepSeek's relationship with the Chinese government. The current environment features widespread disagreement, even among supposed experts, regarding basic facts regarding Chinese AI efforts, nuclear capabilities, and strategic intentions. Information-sharing platforms would bring together nuclear experts, AI specialists, and diplomatic professionals who currently operate in separate worlds with minimal communication, with the aim of avoiding costly misunderstandings during crisis situations.

## Why it matters
Decision-makers in AI policy often operate with incomplete or inaccurate information about other nations' AI capabilities and intentions. This information gap increases the risk of miscalculation and could lead to unnecessary escalation or dangerous complacency.
