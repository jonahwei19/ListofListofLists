# Cyber Weapons for AI Disruption

**Source**: Peregrine 2025, Proposal #175
**Original**: https://riskmitigation.ai/wp-content/uploads/The-2025-Peregrine-Report.pdf
**Specificity**: Specific technique

## What it is
Develop specialized cyberweapons specifically designed to disrupt, sabotage, or shut down AI training runs. Like Stuxnet was developed by studying centrifuges, this would require acquiring GPUs or similar hardware to discover zero-day vulnerabilities specific to AI systems. The capabilities would serve as both deterrence against unauthorized AGI development and as emergency intervention tools if intelligence explosion risks are detected internationally. This approach recognizes that verification alone may be insufficient without enforcement mechanisms.

## Why it matters
Verification and treaties require enforcement mechanisms. Purpose-built tools to disrupt unauthorized AI development provide a credible deterrent and emergency intervention capability when diplomatic measures fail.
