## Domain 5: International Coordination (Proposals #115-133)

### Improving Communication Channels

**#115 - Cross-Border Notification Systems**
- **Goal:** Create mechanisms for countries to alert each other about out-of-control AI systems, similar to Cold War "red phones," to prevent misunderstandings during AI safety incidents.
- **Mechanism:** Develop formal notification protocols between nations that enable rapid communication when one party encounters AI control problems or has solutions others lack.
- **Who's working on it:** OECD mentioned as doing related work.

**#116 - CERN for AI**
- **Goal:** Create an international AI development consortium to enable unified research without competitive pressures, allowing complex safety decisions to be deferred to the project itself.
- **Mechanism:** Build a neutral, international testbed facility for evaluating advanced AI systems under controlled conditions, modeled after CERN or Intelsat. Would require dramatically expanding government roles in technology decisions.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

**#117 - International Risk Management**
- **Goal:** Strengthen nascent international initiatives for coordinated AI risk management across borders.
- **Mechanism:** Provide sustained financial and political support to existing frameworks like the UN Pact for the Future and the US Global Catastrophic Risk Management Act, moving them from conceptual frameworks to operational protocols with implementation capabilities.
- **Who's working on it:** UN, US Congress (Sen. Portman's bill mentioned).

**#118 - Global Frameworks for AI Development**
- **Goal:** Establish regular communication channels and coordinated policy responses between countries through designated representatives ("Sherpa" networks).
- **Mechanism:** Build on foundations from the Bletchley Park Summit and Seoul AI Summit, expanding participation and formalizing commitments. China noted as having similar AI risk awareness, creating opportunities for agreement.
- **Who's working on it:** Builds on UK government summits (Bletchley Park, Seoul).

**#119 - Strategic Coordination Frameworks**
- **Goal:** Develop coherent strategies where interventions strengthen each other rather than being fragmented or contradictory.
- **Mechanism:** Create integrated policy responses where components complement each other, avoiding conflicts (e.g., between centralizing AI development to mitigate races and decentralizing to mitigate power concentration).
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

**#120 - Realistic End States for AI Governance**
- **Goal:** Produce technically and geopolitically realistic models of long-term AI governance equilibria.
- **Mechanism:** Engage in theoretical research on potential end states including: alignment keeping pace with capabilities, mutually assured destruction arrangements, coordinated slowdown, singleton scenarios, and robust international governance regimes. Could include treaties prohibiting concealed computing centers and mutual monitoring.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

**#121 - International Governance Trifecta**
- **Goal:** Reduce competitive pressures in AI development by creating mechanisms for international agreement verification.
- **Mechanism:** Establish predecessor organizations to international AI governance bodies modeled after IAEA and ISS, partially enabled by flexible hardware governance technologies. Would provide critical time for implementing safety measures.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

**#122 - Geopolitical Sense-Making**
- **Goal:** Create shared understanding of critical developments like DeepSeek's relationship with the Chinese government, avoiding costly misunderstandings during crises.
- **Mechanism:** Build robust information-sharing platforms bringing together nuclear experts, AI specialists, and diplomatic professionals who currently operate in separate worlds with minimal communication.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

### Workshops, Organizations, and Diplomacy

**#123 - Compute Supply Chain**
- **Goal:** Organize key nations in the AI compute supply chain to recognize their collective leverage in moderating AI development pace.
- **Mechanism:** Run workshops through organizations like Safe AI Forum (SAIF) to establish coordination mechanisms between semiconductor manufacturing countries (Netherlands, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, US), creating practical enforcement mechanisms for future AI treaties.
- **Who's working on it:** Safe AI Forum (SAIF) mentioned.

**#124 - Intergovernmental Frontier Model Forum**
- **Goal:** Facilitate international treaty development and red line enforcement before concerns like biological weapons uplift become critical.
- **Mechanism:** Allocate hundreds of millions of USD to METR while developing an international version of the Frontier Model Forum structured like WHO but focused on AI threat models. Unlike current Forum, would abandon exclusive membership for universal participation (including DeepSeek and xAI).
- **Who's working on it:** METR, Frontier Model Forum (current version lacks key players).

**#125 - EU Diplomatic Capacity**
- **Goal:** Position Europe as a credible third pole in global AI governance, particularly valuable as US-China contact may become more challenging.
- **Mechanism:** Empower the EU AI Office and External Action Service (EEAS). EU could negotiate supply chain agreements and host third-party auditors trusted by both US and China. Switzerland noted as uniquely neutral party that could credibly signal to China.
- **Who's working on it:** EU AI Office, EEAS.

**#126 - International Protocols for AI Treaties**
- **Goal:** Enable international auditing of future AI treaties with verification mechanisms similar to nuclear non-proliferation.
- **Mechanism:** Develop hardware and protocols supporting verification mechanisms. US-China dialogues particularly need scaling and formalization. Hardware components coupled with new verification technologies mentioned as key bottlenecks.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

### Building Informal Alliances

**#127 - Specialized Diplomatic Corps**
- **Goal:** Build bandwidth for substantive communication at the nation-state level, particularly for engagement with China.
- **Mechanism:** Create specialized diplomatic corps with multilingual capacity and deep technical understanding of frontier capabilities. Could operate as third parties rather than from within governments or labs. Gates Foundation mentioned as potential supporter if they develop strategy quickly enough.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned; Gates Foundation as potential supporter.

**#128 - International Exchange Program**
- **Goal:** Build future diplomatic capacity through years of deliberate relationship cultivation between US and China.
- **Mechanism:** Fund individuals to travel regularly between China and US, building personal relationships and trust networks. Current touch points are extremely limited, often involving the same small circle of academics.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

**#129 - Track 2 Diplomacy**
- **Goal:** Build sufficient mutual understanding and trust between major powers, establishing potential points of agreement before formal negotiations.
- **Mechanism:** Fund unofficial diplomatic channels between major countries on AI development (especially US and China), with focus on government officials who may be influential in pursuing formal agreements on development limitations and safety standards.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

### Changing the Geopolitical Landscape

**#130 - Consolidation of AI Development**
- **Goal:** Enable better governance, oversight, and more effective implementation of safety measures and alignment techniques.
- **Mechanism:** Reduce the number of organizations building frontier AI systems. Could resemble an "AGI Manhattan Project" where frontier technology is controlled by a single entity implementing unified safety protocols, enabling coordinated pausing based on safety considerations.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

**#131 - Western Multipolar AGI**
- **Goal:** Create alternatives to US-based systems, preventing problematic concentration of power and creating more balanced governance structures.
- **Mechanism:** Support non-US Western AGI projects (such as in the UK) as a counterbalance to US dominance in AI capabilities.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

**#132 - Conflict Reduction**
- **Goal:** Resolve major global conflicts (particularly those involving nuclear powers) before advanced AI development increases geopolitical tensions.
- **Mechanism:** Develop scenarios for how nuclear threats might manifest during AI negotiations and create strategies to prevent escalation. Special consideration for nuclear powers that might use nuclear capability as negotiating leverage.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

**#133 - Country-Level Consolidation**
- **Goal:** Reduce the number of countries with frontier AI labs to enable more effective nonproliferation treaties.
- **Mechanism:** Super-lobbying efforts combined with establishing hardware-level monitoring and verification mechanisms. Limiting the number of parties needed for treaty effectiveness.
- **Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.
