### 195. Psychological Interventions for AGI Integrity
**Goal:** Address AI systems' growing ability to model and influence human psychology at scale.

---

### 196. New AI-Human Interaction Theory
**Goal:** Create mathematical frameworks for understanding interactions between powerful AI systems and humans.
**Mechanism:** Develop new theory integrating communication constraints and computational limitations that current game theory doesn't address; analyze equilibria in multi-agent systems where computational capacity itself becomes a strategic resource.
**Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

---

### 197. Foundations of Cooperative Agency Research
**Goal:** Determine whether creating inherently "cooperative agents" is a meaningful framing for AI safety.
**Mechanism:** Establish whether specific propensities and capabilities built into AI agents can reliably produce good outcomes, or if the infrastructure around the agents matters more than their internal design.
**Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

---

### 198. Beyond Preference Models
**Goal:** Develop more robust foundations for alignment beyond preference satisfaction.
**Mechanism:** Challenge the dominant paradigm that focuses exclusively on preference satisfaction; develop alignment approaches not limited to liberal individualistic models of aggregating preferences.
**Who's working on it:** Zhi-Xuan et al. (2024) cited for related work ("Beyond Preferences in AI Alignment").

---

### 199. AI Sentience Research
**Goal:** Explore consciousness and sentience in artificial systems and how this impacts alignment strategies.
**Mechanism:** Research whether machine consciousness is possible and what forms it might take; avoid anthropomorphizing AI systems, "alien fatalism," or denying all cognitive properties to AI systems ("anthropectomy").
**Who's working on it:** Eleos AI Research mentioned.

---

### 200. Personnel Reliability Programs
**Goal:** Eliminate worst outcomes from geopolitical adversaries or mentally unstable individuals having access to AGI-level systems.
**Mechanism:** Mandate screening and monitoring of personnel who have access to powerful AI systems, similar to security clearances in intelligence or cybersecurity domains.
**Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

---

### 201. Ethics for AI Alignment
**Goal:** Rigorously investigate which future AI development should be trying to achieve before entrusting AI systems with substantial power.
**Mechanism:** Conduct research into the properties AI systems would need to possess; make explicit decisions about the values that should guide AI development rather than attempting to solve technical problems without addressing underlying ethics.
**Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

---

### 202. Opponent Shaping
**Goal:** Create agents that de-escalate conflicts without requiring control over how other agents are designed.
**Mechanism:** Develop AI systems designed to shape the learning and behavior of other agents toward mutually beneficial constructive outcomes rather than just optimizing against their strategies.
**Who's working on it:** Not mentioned.

---

### 203. Autonomous Weapons Monitoring
**Goal:** Prevent particularly dangerous military applications of AI and conflict escalation without human intervention.
**Mechanism:** Establish comprehensive monitoring systems for AI applications in weaponry; track development of autonomous decision-making capabilities in weapons systems; create transparency about which systems maintain meaningful human oversight versus fully autonomous operation.
**Who's working on it:** Not mentioned; noted as requiring international agreements.

---

### 204. Legal Personhood Framework
**Goal:** Channel advanced AI systems toward legal means of goal achievement rather than extra-legal actions.
