## Overview

Engineering-focused biosecurity gap analysis. Argues the field is dominated by biologists and policy people, neglecting physical/materials science interventions. "Laughably neglected" framing.

## Proposals and Mapping

| Proposal | Kill Chain Step | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Next-Gen PPE** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Face masks "barely changed for decades." Need: high effectiveness + ease of use + low cost. Distinct from commodity PPE. |
| **Far-UVC Deployment** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Indoor pathogen suppression via 222nm UV. Complementary to ventilation. Pathogen-agnostic defense. |
| **Ventilation Systems** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Building HVAC improvements for respiratory transmission reduction. Infrastructure-level intervention. |
| **Upper-Room UVGI** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Ceiling-mounted UV for continuous air disinfection. Established technology, under-deployed. |
| **High-Containment Lab Safety** | [[terrorism/proliferation]] | Modernizing BSL-3/4 infrastructure. Aging technology, slow adoption. Prevents lab accidents/releases. |
| **Biomonitoring Hardware** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Environmental sampling, point-of-care diagnostics, sequencing hardware. Detection infrastructure. |
| **Vehicle Air Filtration** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Aircraft/ship environmental controls. Transmission reduction during travel. |

## Key Insight

**Hardware gap**: Most biosecurity work is "software" (policy, biology, modeling). Physical/engineering interventions are under-invested. Author argues this creates opportunity for engineers/materials scientists to have outsized impact.

All proposals target **extinction** step (defense/containment) except lab safety which partially targets **proliferation** (preventing release).

## What's Novel

- **Distinct framing**: Not "what biology research is needed" but "what physical objects need to exist"
- **Skill-based targeting**: Explicit call to engineers, not biologists
- **Far-UVC emphasis**: Treats this as distinct intervention category, not subset of ventilation

## Overlap with Existing

- PPE: Also in concrete-biosecurity-ea (Super PPE)
- Biomonitoring: Also in Peregrine (metagenomic surveillance)
- Ventilation/UVGI: Standard pandemic preparedness
