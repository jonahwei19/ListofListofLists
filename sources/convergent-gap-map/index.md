# Convergent Research Gap Map

**Source**: https://www.gap-map.org/
**Original**: https://www.gap-map.org/
**Date processed**: 2026-01-11
**Total items**: 101 R&D gaps across 17 scientific fields

## Filtering

Most gaps are **out of scope** (astrophysics, materials science, space engineering, general physics, etc.). Filtered for civilizational resilience relevance.

## Relevant Gaps

### AI Safety/Security (Computation domain)
| # | Gap | Maps to | Notes |
|---|-----|---------|-------|
| 30 | AI Could Go Rogue | [[problems/verify-ai-alignment]], [[problems/contain-unsafe-ai]] | Core alignment problem |
| 31 | AI Could Be Misused | [[problems/defend-against-ai-harms]] | Misuse/dual-use concern |
| 32 | Compute Stack is Insecure | [[interventions/formally-verified-software]] | Cybersecurity intervention |
| 33 | AI is Narrow in Reasoning | Not relevant | Capability limitation, not safety problem |

### Biosecurity
| # | Gap | Maps to | Notes |
|---|-----|---------|-------|
| 58 | Microbes Out-Evolve Defenses | [[interventions/broad-spectrum-countermeasures]] | Medical countermeasures |
| 59 | Inadequate Transmission Blockers | [[interventions/uv-environmental-sanitization]] | Physical barriers |
| 60 | Insufficient Bio-Threat Surveillance | [[interventions/metagenomic-pathogen-surveillance]] | Detection |
| 61 | Malicious Bioengineering Risks | NEW: DNA synthesis screening, biosecurity controls | Prevention |
| 62 | Fragile Supply Chains | [[interventions/backup-planning]] | Resilience infrastructure |

### Social/Epistemic
| # | Gap | Maps to | Notes |
|---|-----|---------|-------|
| 63 | Epistemics/Misinformation | NEW: [[problems/ensure-epistemic-security]] | Already have source doc for this |
| 64 | Labor-Replacing AI Disempowerment | Dystopia concern | Lower priority - not mass casualty |
| 65 | Democratic Platforms | Out of scope | Governance process, not resilience |

### Global Health
| # | Gap | Maps to | Notes |
|---|-----|---------|-------|
| 77 | Under-Provisioning Vaccines/Antibiotics | [[interventions/rapid-medical-countermeasures]] | Overlaps with biosecurity |
| 78 | Limited Diagnostics | Out of scope | General health infrastructure |
| 79 | Low-Resource Infrastructure | Out of scope | Development, not resilience |

## Not Used (Out of Scope)

- #1-29: Computation fundamentals, chemistry, synthetic biology, materials, mechanical engineering
- #34: Biological computation (basic science)
- #35-40: Climate/geophysics (important but separate domain)
- #41-50: Astrophysics, particle physics
- #51-57: Ecology, space engineering
- #66-76: Social science tooling, metascience, education (not direct resilience)
- #80-101: Biophysics, physiology, neuroscience (basic science)

## New Entries to Consider

1. **DNA synthesis screening** - preventing malicious bioengineering (#61)
   - Already covered partially by nucleic-acid-synthesis-screening intervention
   - May need dedicated problem entry for "prevent engineered pathogen creation"

2. **Epistemic security** - already have source doc, process separately

## Summary

Of 101 gaps, **~10 are directly relevant** to civilizational resilience. Most map to existing entries. The biosecurity cluster (#58-62) is well-covered by existing intervention pages. Gap #63 (epistemics) connects to the epistemic-security source we have queued.

No new problem entries needed from this source - it validates existing structure rather than expanding it.
