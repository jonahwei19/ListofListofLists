## Core Findings

### Knowledge Level

Models surpassed PhD-level experts by 2025:
- 2022 baseline: -0.4 relative to human experts
- 2025 performance: +0.6 relative to human experts

### Protocol Generation

> First feasible protocols validated in wet labs in late 2024.

### Plasmid Design Shift

> "AI-assisted plasmid design represents major shift in capabilities: what was previously...multi-step process requiring specialised bioinformatics expertise might now be streamlined from weeks to days."

## Detailed Metrics

| Capability | Metric | Result |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Troubleshooting | Score vs human experts | ~90% higher (absolute: 44%) |
| Multimodal troubleshooting | Expert outperformance | First achieved mid-2025 |
| Protocol generation | Wet-lab validation | First achieved late 2024 |
| Biology QA | Questions tested | 280+ per domain |

## Evaluation Methodology

The AISI biosecurity evaluation includes:
1. Open-ended chemistry/biology QA (280+ questions per domain)
2. Protocol generation with feasibility rubrics (1-10 scoring)
3. Plasmid design tasks with tool access
4. Multimodal troubleshooting using images
5. **Wet-lab validation of generated protocols**

Human baseline: PhD holders or equivalent with 4+ years domain experience.

## Implications

1. **Time compression**: Multi-week expert processes reduced to days
2. **Expertise democratization**: Specialized bioinformatics knowledge becoming accessible through AI
3. **Dual-use concern**: Same capabilities enabling beneficial research also lower barriers for malicious actors

## Safeguard Status

- Better defenses in biological misuse category vs other domains
- Universal jailbreaks still found in every tested system
- "Basic techniques can cheaply remove trained-in refusal behaviour" for open-source models
