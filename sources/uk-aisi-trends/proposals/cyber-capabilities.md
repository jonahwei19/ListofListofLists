# Proposal: AI Cyber Capability Doubling Time

**Source:** UK AISI Frontier AI Trends Report (2026)
**Category:** Cyber Security

---

## Core Finding

> "The length of cyber tasks (expressed as how long they would take a human expert) that models can complete unassisted is doubling roughly every eight months."

---

## Supporting Data

| Metric | Early Period | Late Period | Timeframe |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Apprentice-level task performance | ~10% | 50% | 2024-2025 |
| Task duration capability | <10 min | >1 hour | Early 2023 - Mid 2025 |
| Expert-level achievement | None | 10+ years equivalent | First in 2025 |

---

## Detailed Metrics

- **Task complexity progression**: Models progressed from completing tasks requiring <10 minutes of human expert time (early 2023) to tasks requiring over an hour (mid-2025)
- **Cyber range performance**: Low success rates on multi-step realistic challenges; only early flags show increasing completion
- **First expert-level capability**: 2025 saw the first model achieving performance equivalent to a human expert with 10+ years experience

## Implications

The 8-month doubling time provides a concrete empirical basis for:
1. Forecasting when AI systems may achieve specific cyber capability thresholds
2. Planning defensive infrastructure investments ahead of capability curves
3. Setting policy timelines for security governance

---

## Proposal Relevance

This finding is critical for:
- **Risk assessment**: Quantitative basis for capability forecasting
- **Defense prioritization**: Understanding the shrinking window for defensive preparation
- **Governance timing**: Setting realistic deadlines for security measures before capabilities become widely accessible
