## Overview

Six major biosecurity projects estimated to reduce catastrophic biorisk by >1% each. EA-native framing, longtermist focus. Executive talent identified as key constraint.

## Proposals and Mapping

| Proposal | Kill Chain Step | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Early Detection Center** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Metagenomic surveillance at travel hubs. Detect novel pathogens before spread. Maps to detection/response. |
| **Super PPE** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Next-gen protective equipment for mass stockpiling. Cheap, reliable, long-lasting. Defensive infrastructure. |
| **Medical Countermeasures** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Broad-spectrum vaccines, antivirals, mAbs. Authors note dual-use caution. Defensive capability. |
| **BWC Strengthening** | [[terrorism/proliferation]] | Verification mechanisms, whistleblower incentives, open-source monitoring. Prevents capability spread. |
| **Sterilization Technology** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Ionizing radiation, broad antiseptic. Pathogen-agnostic decontamination. |
| **Refuges** | [[terrorism/extinction]] | Civilization bunkers with pathogen testing and countermeasure development capacity. Last-line defense. |

## Key Insight

Most proposals target the **extinction** step (containment/response after attack). Only BWC Strengthening targets **proliferation** (prevent capability reaching bad actors). No proposals directly target **creation** (prevent AI from providing bio uplift).

Gap: The AI-bio intersection isn't addressed here—this is traditional biosecurity, not AI-enabled bio threats specifically.

## Overlap with Existing

- Metagenomic surveillance: Already in Peregrine, well-established intervention
- PPE stockpiles: Already covered
- Refuges: Novel framing—"Mars on Earth" analogy useful

## What's New

- "Super PPE" as distinct from commodity PPE—next-gen design goal
- Refuges with countermeasure development capacity (not just survival bunkers)
- Sterilization technology as distinct intervention category
