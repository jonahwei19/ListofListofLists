This constitutes a compilation of longtermist biosecurity initiatives. The authors believe most could diminish catastrophic biological risk by exceeding 1% on the current margin (in relative terms). While confident important work exists within each area, their confidence in specific pathways differs substantially, and each idea requires deeper investigation.

These domains represent vital biosecurity infrastructure components deserving progress. Interested parties should complete a coordination form to receive updates on involvement opportunities.

## Early Detection Center

Detecting biorisks promptly extends response time for developing countermeasures, deploying protective gear, and executing evacuation procedures. Current novel pathogen warning approaches prove inadequate, typically depending on astute clinical observation paired with elimination of conventional diagnoses. Existing frameworks concentrate almost exclusively on recognized pathogens rather than employing pathogen-agnostic detection capable of identifying unfamiliar organisms.

A straightforward objective involves assembling a modest team collecting specimens from international volunteer travelers, followed by comprehensive metagenomic analysis. Processing merely 100 daily samples could substantially alter outcomes by catching threats before widespread transmission. The authors estimate implementation with contemporary technology at under $50 million annually.

Decomposing this challenge reveals multiple bottlenecks. Ethan is developing subproblem recommendations to be linked subsequently.

## Super PPE

Contemporary personal protective equipment exhibits substantial deficiencies. Standard masks and protective suits demand proper fitting instruction, lack reusability, and address routine rather than catastrophic scenarios. Extreme-use PPE variants (biosafety level 4 suits, military-grade protection) present problems: they are cumbersome, severely limiting, and insufficient in quantity for widespread distribution among millions if required.

Materials innovation and thoughtful engineering could potentially yield next-generation protective equipment combining extreme effectiveness, user-friendliness, extended operational duration, and affordability with adequate supply.

A specific commercial objective targets manufacturing a protective suit enabling severely immunocompromised individuals to maintain reasonably typical lives, priced competitively enough for acquiring 100 million units for the Strategic National Stockpile. Military-grade specifications—such as defending against direct anthrax exposure—represent an additional aspiration.

PPE advantages include being genuinely pathogen-agnostic (stockpiled before threat identification) and defensively stable (physical barriers resist pathogen engineering circumvention). See Carl Shulman's analysis on civilization immunization for elaboration.

Ethan will issue a comprehensive PPE examination later, with subsequent linking.

## Medical Countermeasures

Medical interventions (vaccines, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies) addressing catastrophic biological risks present numerous limitations. Generally tailored to established pathogens (like smallpox vaccines), they offer minimal protection against novel threats. Numerous interventions lack resilience against deliberate modification—antibiotics demonstrate broad effectiveness but remain susceptible to engineering circumvention.

Eventually, opportunities may emerge for substantially enhanced medical countermeasures against catastrophic threats, through either targeted responses against concerning pathogens or comprehensive-spectrum approaches, or establishing rapid-deployment systems maintaining reliability even against intentional adversaries.

The authors remain unprepared recommending medical countermeasures as universal large-scale project focus areas presently, partly because numerous initiatives carry unintended adverse consequences (viral vector-utilizing platforms might accelerate pathogen engineering technology). Interested applicants should complete the coordination form for customized guidance.

## BWC Strengthening

The Biological Weapons Convention—the international instrument prohibiting biological weapons—operates with minimal staffing (four individuals) and lacks verification mechanisms. Scope exists for imaginative treaty reinforcement approaches (including whistleblower incentives) or establishing fresh bilateral arrangements while sidestepping bureaucratic obstacles. A dedicated research team analyzing publicly available information (academic publications, employment postings, equipment procurement channels) might obstruct illicit laboratory operations, thereby strengthening treaty adherence.

## Sterilization Technology

Sterilization methods employing physical mechanisms (ionizing radiation) or nonspecific antimicrobial qualities (hydrogen peroxide, bleach) rather than molecular precision (selective antibiotics) offer advantages: broad applicability, engineering resistance, minimal problematic dual-use potential.

Existing physical sterilization approaches (ultraviolet radiation, antimicrobial material science) present varying limitations regarding expense, accessibility, and implementation practicality. This represents an under-researched domain for both prevention and response development. Although considerable uncertainties persist, investigation value appears substantial.

## Refuges

Current bunker infrastructure provides reasonable protection, though specially engineered refuges could enhance pandemic defense (implementing personnel rotation with comprehensive pathogen-agnostic screening, incorporating civilization-restoration materials, potentially enabling protective-space-based countermeasure creation). Maintaining perpetual partial-population quarantine through this mechanism reduces transmission risk.

Alternative framing: widespread confidence that Mars settlements substantially decrease biological risk parallels Earth-based equivalents at substantially lower expense, delivering comparable protection.

A preliminary action involves establishing an organization specializing in operational, logistical, and vendor coordination for refuge construction with appropriate amenities. Preliminary investigation suggests outsourcing around $100-300 million per bunker, though investigation depth was shallow. Additional concepts are under development with forthcoming linking.

## Conclusions

Several observations merit emphasis:

These endeavors collectively might engage substantial quantities of aligned engineering capability and capital resources. Executive talent may represent the binding constraint, as it enables productive deployment of additional talent and funding.

Numerous most-promising actions avoid biology or bioengineering technical bottlenecks. EA technologists pursuing biological work should consider alternative engineering specialization alongside generalist problem-solving capabilities rather than exclusively pursuing biological knowledge.

These projects demonstrate comparatively favorable evaluation mechanisms (surpassing most longtermist work), positioning this domain as encouraging testing ground for meta-EA experiments, particularly regarding entrepreneurial development.

Despite viewing certain biosecurity work as scalable and promising, the authors question whether biosecurity should constitute substantially expanded longtermist resource allocation. From purely longtermist perspectives, artificial intelligence appears 10-100× more significant than biosecurity, despite biosecurity potentially offering greater tractability advantages. Biosecurity additionally merits consideration for non-longtermist reasons, given preventing severe-but-not-civilization-ending catastrophes (10-100× COVID magnitude)—thus potentially appealing greater to near-term impact priorities.
