## Quoted passage

> Medical interventions (vaccines, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies) addressing catastrophic biological risks present numerous limitations. Generally tailored to established pathogens (like smallpox vaccines), they offer minimal protection against novel threats. Numerous interventions lack resilience against deliberate modification—antibiotics demonstrate broad effectiveness but remain susceptible to engineering circumvention.
>
> Eventually, opportunities may emerge for substantially enhanced medical countermeasures against catastrophic threats, through either targeted responses against concerning pathogens or comprehensive-spectrum approaches, or establishing rapid-deployment systems maintaining reliability even against intentional adversaries.
>
> The authors remain unprepared recommending medical countermeasures as universal large-scale project focus areas presently, partly because numerous initiatives carry unintended adverse consequences (viral vector-utilizing platforms might accelerate pathogen engineering technology).
