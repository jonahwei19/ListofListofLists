## Quoted passage

> Sterilization methods employing physical mechanisms (ionizing radiation) or nonspecific antimicrobial qualities (hydrogen peroxide, bleach) rather than molecular precision (selective antibiotics) offer advantages: broad applicability, engineering resistance, minimal problematic dual-use potential.
>
> Existing physical sterilization approaches (ultraviolet radiation, antimicrobial material science) present varying limitations regarding expense, accessibility, and implementation practicality. This represents an under-researched domain for both prevention and response development. Although considerable uncertainties persist, investigation value appears substantial.
