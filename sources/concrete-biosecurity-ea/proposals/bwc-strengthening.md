## Quoted passage

> The Biological Weapons Convention—the international instrument prohibiting biological weapons—operates with minimal staffing (four individuals) and lacks verification mechanisms. Scope exists for imaginative treaty reinforcement approaches (including whistleblower incentives) or establishing fresh bilateral arrangements while sidestepping bureaucratic obstacles. A dedicated research team analyzing publicly available information (academic publications, employment postings, equipment procurement channels) might obstruct illicit laboratory operations, thereby strengthening treaty adherence.
