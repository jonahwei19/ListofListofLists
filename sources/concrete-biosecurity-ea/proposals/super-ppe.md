## Quoted passage

> Contemporary personal protective equipment exhibits substantial deficiencies. Standard masks and protective suits demand proper fitting instruction, lack reusability, and address routine rather than catastrophic scenarios. Extreme-use PPE variants (biosafety level 4 suits, military-grade protection) present problems: they are cumbersome, severely limiting, and insufficient in quantity for widespread distribution among millions if required.
>
> Materials innovation and thoughtful engineering could potentially yield next-generation protective equipment combining extreme effectiveness, user-friendliness, extended operational duration, and affordability with adequate supply.
>
> A specific commercial objective targets manufacturing a protective suit enabling severely immunocompromised individuals to maintain reasonably typical lives, priced competitively enough for acquiring 100 million units for the Strategic National Stockpile. Military-grade specifications—such as defending against direct anthrax exposure—represent an additional aspiration.
>
> PPE advantages include being genuinely pathogen-agnostic (stockpiled before threat identification) and defensively stable (physical barriers resist pathogen engineering circumvention).
