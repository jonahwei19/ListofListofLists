## Quoted passage

> Current bunker infrastructure provides reasonable protection, though specially engineered refuges could enhance pandemic defense (implementing personnel rotation with comprehensive pathogen-agnostic screening, incorporating civilization-restoration materials, potentially enabling protective-space-based countermeasure creation). Maintaining perpetual partial-population quarantine through this mechanism reduces transmission risk.
>
> Alternative framing: widespread confidence that Mars settlements substantially decrease biological risk parallels Earth-based equivalents at substantially lower expense, delivering comparable protection.
>
> A preliminary action involves establishing an organization specializing in operational, logistical, and vendor coordination for refuge construction with appropriate amenities. Preliminary investigation suggests outsourcing around $100-300 million per bunker, though investigation depth was shallow.
