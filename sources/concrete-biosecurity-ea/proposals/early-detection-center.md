## Quoted passage

> Detecting biorisks promptly extends response time for developing countermeasures, deploying protective gear, and executing evacuation procedures. Current novel pathogen warning approaches prove inadequate, typically depending on astute clinical observation paired with elimination of conventional diagnoses. Existing frameworks concentrate almost exclusively on recognized pathogens rather than employing pathogen-agnostic detection capable of identifying unfamiliar organisms.
>
> A straightforward objective involves assembling a modest team collecting specimens from international volunteer travelers, followed by comprehensive metagenomic analysis. Processing merely 100 daily samples could substantially alter outcomes by catching threats before widespread transmission. The authors estimate implementation with contemporary technology at under $50 million annually.
