## Sub-Lists Identified

### High Priority (adding as separate sources)

| List | URL | Focus | Why Add |
|------|-----|-------|---------|
| Concrete Biosecurity Projects (EA) | [Link](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/u5JesqQ3jdLENXBtB/concrete-biosecurity-projects-some-of-which-could-be-big-1) | NAO, next-gen PPE, refuges | EA-native, substantial |
| Apollo Program for Biodefense | [Link](https://biodefensecommission.org/reports/the-apollo-program-for-biodefense-winning-the-race-against-biological-threats/) | Comprehensive roadmap | Government-adjacent, specific targets |
| Technologies to Address GCBRs | [Link](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/publications/technologies-to-address-global-catastrophic-biological-risks) | Emerging tech inventory | Johns Hopkins, detailed |
| Biosecurity Needs Engineers | [Link](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Bd7K4XCg4BGEaSetp/biosecurity-needs-engineers-and-materials-scientists) | Hardware/PPE | Unique engineering focus |

### Medium Priority (may add later)

| List | URL | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| 20 Concrete X-Risk Projects | [Link](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AJwuMw7ddcKQNFLcR/20-concrete-projects-for-reducing-existential-risk) | Multi-domain, biosecurity subset |
| New Ideas for Biotech Misuse | [Link](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c9KFL8sBxxyPqLai4/new-ideas-for-mitigating-biotechnology-misuse) | Governance focus |

### Lower Priority (skip for now)

| List | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Vitalik Techno-Optimism | High-level, less actionable |
| Future Fund Project Ideas | Defunct org, historical |
| Grant databases | Funding records, not project ideas |

## Consensus Projects (appear across multiple lists)

These are mentioned repeatedly, suggesting high priority:
- **Nucleic Acid Observatory / metagenomic surveillance** → already covered: [[metagenomic-pathogen-surveillance]]
- **Far-UVC germicidal lighting** → already covered: [[uv-environmental-sanitization]]
- **Next-generation PPE** → already covered: [[broad-spectrum-countermeasures]]
- **Rapid vaccine platforms (100-day targets)** → already covered: [[broad-spectrum-countermeasures]]
- **Gene synthesis screening** → mentioned but no dedicated page yet
- **Biological attribution systems** → mentioned but no dedicated page yet

## New Interventions to Consider

1. **Gene synthesis screening** - Cross-list consensus, distinct from surveillance
2. **Biological attribution** - Forensics for identifying attack sources

## Summary

Meta-list pointing to 8 source lists. 4 high-priority sub-lists added as separate sources. Most consensus projects already covered in existing interventions. May need dedicated pages for synthesis screening and attribution.
